To investigate the expression of microRNA-324-3p (miR-324-3p) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells. A total of 60 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into normal group (n=30) and experimental group (n=30). Rats in the experimental group were intramuscularly injected with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6 mg/100 g of body weight) and 0.2 mL oil for injection, while those in normal group were intramuscularly injected with 0.2 mL oil for injection. The ovarian tissues of PCOS model rats were removed to extract the total ribose nucleic acid (RNA). The expression of miR-324-3p was detected via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Primary ovarian granulosa cells were isolated and cultured, and NC-miRNA and miR-324-3p mimic were transfected into cells. After 48 h, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected via cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The targeted molecule of miR-324-3p was explored using bioinformatics, and dual-luciferase assay was performed to verify the effect of miR-324-3p on WNT2B expression. Granulosa cells were co-transfected with WNT2B-small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and miR-324-3p mimic, and then cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected via CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The expression of miR-324-3p in ovarian tissues of PCOS group was significantly lower than that of normal group (p < 0.01). After transfection with miR-324-3p mimic into granulosa cells, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was promoted (p < 0.01). MiR-324-3p exerted its effect on granulosa cells by directly targeting WNT2B. Silencing WNT2B expression could reverse the effects of miR-324-3p on proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells (p < 0.05). The expression of miR-324-3p in the ovary of PCOS rats is decreased significantly. Overexpression of miR-324-3p can reduce the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of granulosa cells via targeting of WNT2B.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 78, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 255, "charStart": 80}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 372, "charStart": 257}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 615, "charStart": 374}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 715, "charStart": 617}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 819, "charStart": 717}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 942, "charStart": 821}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1073, "charStart": 944}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1240, "charStart": 1075}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1445, "charStart": 1242}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1569, "charStart": 1447}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1723, "charStart": 1571}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1801, "charStart": 1725}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1930, "charStart": 1803}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2013, "charStart": 1932}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2139, "charStart": 2015}], "mesh": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Granulosa Cells", "MicroRNAs", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Wnt Proteins"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

{"text": "MicroRNA-145-5p regulates fibrotic features of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa skin fibroblasts. BACKGROUND: Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a skin fragility disorder caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, a cutaneous basement membrane component essential for epidermal-dermal adhesion. Hallmarks of the disease are unremitting blistering and chronic wounds with severe inflammation and fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression also implicated in fibrotic processes. However, the role of miRNAs in RDEB fibrosis is almost unexplored. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify miRNAs deregulated in primary RDEB skin fibroblasts (RDEBFs) and to characterize their function in RDEB fibrosis. METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to screen RDEBFs for expression levels of a group of miRNAs deregulated in hypertrophic scars and keloids, pathological conditions with abnormal wound healing and fibrosis. Contractility, proliferation and migration rate were evaluated by different in\u00a0vitro assays in RDEBFs transfected with a miR-145-5p inhibitor. Expression levels of fibrotic markers and miR-145-5p targets were measured using qRT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: The miR-143/145 cluster was upregulated in RDEBFs compared with fibroblasts from healthy subjects. RDEBFs transfected with a miR-145-5p inhibitor showed attenuated fibrotic traits of contraction, proliferation and migration, accompanied by reduced expression of the contractile proteins \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transgelin. These effects were associated with upregulation of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 transcriptional repressor and downregulation of Jagged1, a known inducer of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the profibrotic role of miR-145-5p and its regulatory networks in RDEB, shedding light on novel disease pathomechanisms and targets for future therapeutic approaches. What's already known about this topic? Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a highly disabling genetic skin disease caused by mutations in the collagen VII gene and characterized by unremitting blistering and defective wound healing, leading to inflammation and fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in health and disease, and their deregulation has been implicated in fibrotic skin conditions. To date, only miR-29 has been associated with injury-driven fibrosis in RDEB. What does this study add? In patients with RDEB, miR-145-5p is overexpressed in RDEB skin fibroblasts (RDEBFs), where it plays a profibrotic role, as its inhibition reduces RDEBF fibrotic traits (contraction, proliferation and migration). miR-145-5p inhibition in RDEBFs determines the reduction of contractile markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transgelin through upregulation of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4, a transcriptional repressor of contractile proteins, and downregulation of Jagged1 (JAG1), an inducer of fibrosis. What is the translational message? Our findings expand the knowledge on miRNA-driven pathomechanisms implicated in RDEB fibrosis. miR-145-5p and its targets (e.g. JAG1) could represent relevant molecules for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract fibrosis progression in patients with RDEB.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 106}, "docId": "30816994", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 106, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 345, "charStart": 108}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 455, "charStart": 347}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 568, "charStart": 457}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 635, "charStart": 570}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 789, "charStart": 637}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1039, "charStart": 791}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1182, "charStart": 1041}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1289, "charStart": 1184}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1397, "charStart": 1291}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1623, "charStart": 1399}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1782, "charStart": 1625}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1984, "charStart": 1784}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2023, "charStart": 1986}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2272, "charStart": 2025}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2441, "charStart": 2274}, {"index": 16, "charEnd": 2519, "charStart": 2443}, {"index": 17, "charEnd": 2545, "charStart": 2521}, {"index": 18, "charEnd": 2758, "charStart": 2547}, {"index": 19, "charEnd": 3037, "charStart": 2760}, {"index": 20, "charEnd": 3072, "charStart": 3039}, {"index": 21, "charEnd": 3167, "charStart": 3074}, {"index": 22, "charEnd": 3351, "charStart": 3169}]}

{"text": "Regulatory effect of miR-195 in the placental dysfunction of preeclampsia. Purpose: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy specific disease soon after 20\u2009weeks of gestation where major symptoms are hypertension and proteinuria. The underlying pathology is believed to be abnormal placentation. Epigenetic and genetic factors have significant roles in abnormal placental development. MicroRNA's (miRNAs), being one of the most important epigenetic regulators, take part in abnormal placentation. Hsa-miR-195 is a molecule associated with abnormal placental growth mechanisms such as impaired cellular proliferation, inadequate trophoblastic invasion causing defective spiral artery remodeling, and apoptosis. We aimed to evaluate miRNA functions, namely miR-195 expression profile, in order to divulge PE pathogenesis.Methods: In this study, we extracted circulating miRNAs from maternal plasma and placenta from 20 PE patients and 20 normotensive pregnant women. miR-195 was quantified using quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The target genes of miR-195 were predicted by Diana Tools-mirPath, TargetScan, and miRDB databases.Results: We found that miR-195 levels were downregulated (3.83-fold decrease, p\u2009<\u2009.05) in preeclamptic placenta samples, however miR-195 were undetected in preeclamptic and normotensive plasma samples. The steep down-regulation of miR-195 points to its importance of PE pathogenesis.Conclusion: miR-195 is suggested to regulate PE via its target genes manipulating biological processes such as placental proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known for its high mortality rate worldwide. Based on intensive studies, microRNA (miRNA) expression functions in tumor suppression. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of miR-146a-5p to radiosensitivity in HCC through the activation of the DNA damage repair pathway by binding to replication protein A3 (RPA3). First, the limma package of R was performed to differentially analyze HCC expression chip, and regulative miRNA of RPA3 was predicted. Expression of miR-146a-5p, RPA3, and DNA damage repair pathway-related factors in tissues and cells was determined. The effects of radiotherapy on the expression of miR-146a-5p and RPA3 as well as on cell radiosensitivity, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were also assessed. The results showed that there exists a close correlation between miR-146a and the radiotherapy effect on HCC progression through regulation of RPA3 and the DNA repair pathway. The positive rate of ATM, pCHK2, and Rad51 in HCC tissues was higher when compared with that of the paracancerous tissues. SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cell proliferation were significantly inhibited following 8 Gy 6Mv dose. MiR-146a-5p restrained the expression of RPA3 and promoted the expression of relative genes associated with the DNA repair pathway. In addition, miR-146a-5p overexpression suppresses cell proliferation and enhances radiosensitivity and cell apoptosis in HCC cells.

In a previous study we found the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers, including E-cadherin and N-cadherin, was significantly altered in uterine endometrium during embryo implantation via regulation by microRNA (miRNA)-429 and protocadherin-8 (Pcdh8). As a natural continuation of the previous study, the aim of the present study was to explore the role of EMT during embryo implantation and the potential activity of twist basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 2 (Twist2) in regulating embryo implantation. A pregnancy model was established by naturally mating adult female ICR mice with fertile males. A pseudopregnancy model was established by mating fertile female ICR mice with vasectomised males. An invitro model of embryo implantation was established by the coculture of Ishikawa and JAR spheroids. Endometrial tissue during the peri-implantation period was collected, as were Ishikawa cells, JAR cells and cocultured cells. The expression of EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and cytokeratin) and Twist2 was detected invivo and invitro using the western blot analysis during embryo implantation. The expression of N-cadherin and vimentin (mesenchymal markers) was upregulated in the invitro implantation model, with downregulation of E-cadherin and cytokeratin (epithelial markers) expression. The expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist2 increased significantly at the implantation sites at the time of implantation (Day 5), whereas the expression of E-cadherin and cytokeratin decreased. Location of Twist2 during embryo implantation was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed that it was extensively expressed in endometrial glandular epithelium and luminal epithelium at implantation sites on Day 5. The effect of the expression of Twist2 on embryo implantation was evaluated by suppressing Twist2 using Twist2-short interference (si) RNA in invivo and invitro models. The numbers of implanted embryos and the implantation rate were compared invivo and invitro. Western blot analysis showed that suppression of Twist2 led to upregulation of E-cadherin and cytokeratin, accompanied by downregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin (P<0.05). The number of implanted embryos after Twist2-siRNA interference was lower than in normal pregnancy (mean (\u00b1s.d.) 2.4\u00b10.5 vs 6.8\u00b11.3 respectively; P<0.05).

BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a major obstacle in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Recent studies have shown that exosomes-small membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types-could have a protective effect on the ischemic myocardium. In this study we explored the effect of exosomes derived from bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSC-exo) on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and MIRI. METHODS: Exosomes were purified from culture media using the ExoQuick kit and observed using transmission electron microscopy. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using the Annexin-V/PI stain. The expression levels of microRNA (miRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) and PTEN/PI3K/AKT-pathway-related proteins were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Myocardial ischemia was simulated by incubating H9C2 cells in a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditioned rat MIRI model. RESULTS: BMSC-exo induced the proliferation of H9C2 cells and rescued H9C2 cells from apoptosis in the H/R model, indicating that BMSC-exo has a protective effect on cardiomyocyte injury caused by H/R. Using transgenic H9C2 cells, we found that miR-486-5p in BMSC-exo suppressed the H/R-triggered apoptosis of H9C2 cells. In addition, BMSC-exo repressed the expression of PTEN in H9C2 cells via miR-486-5p, and subsequently activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in vitro. Moreover, the myocardial injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion was repaired by BMSC-exo which activates the PI3K/AKT pathway via miR-486-5p in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that exosomes from BMSCs have a protective effect on myocardium ischemic injury.

We investigated whether expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) related to helper T or Treg cells regulate the Th17/Treg ratio in CD4+ T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 52 active ITP patients and 56 healthy controls. We detected miRNA expression using RT-PCR with stem-loop primers and U6 as control.Th17 and Treg percentages were analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4+ cells were transfected with miRNA (miR-99a, miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p) mimics or inhibitors to investigate their function. RESULTS: miR-99a expression in CD4+ cells in ITP patients was lower than in controls, while expression of miR-182-5p and miR-183-5p were higher in ITP patients. Moreover, Treg percentage correlated positively with miR-99a expression in ITP patients. We found no significant correlation between Th17 percentage and miR-182-5p or miR-183-5p expression. miR-183-5p expression correlated negatively with platelet count, while we found no significant difference between platelet count and miR-99a or miR-182-5p. miR-183-5p expression in CD4+ T cells from severe patients was significantly higher than in those from non-severe patients. Furthermore, down-regulating miR-183-5p expression repressed Th17 differentiation, while up-regulating miR-99a increased Tregs detected in CD4+ cells from ITP patients. In addition, up-regulated miR-99a repressed mTOR and p-mTOR expression. CONCLUSIONS: miR-99a, miR-182-5p, and miR-183-5p expression levels in CD4+ cells were abnormal in ITP patients. Aberrant expression of miRNAs may contribute to the Th17/Treg imbalance in ITP patients and may represent a novel therapeutic target.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 115, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 281, "charStart": 117}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 418, "charStart": 283}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 524, "charStart": 420}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 666, "charStart": 526}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 791, "charStart": 668}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 952, "charStart": 793}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1041, "charStart": 954}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1142, "charStart": 1043}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1298, "charStart": 1144}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1422, "charStart": 1300}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1591, "charStart": 1424}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1663, "charStart": 1593}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1775, "charStart": 1665}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 1909, "charStart": 1777}], "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Th17 Cells", "Young Adult"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

Objectives: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA (miRNA) genes can have diverse functional consequence by affecting the processing and target selection of miRNA. Recent evidence indicates that miRNA play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which is a major cause of ischemic stroke (IS). The aim of this study was to clarify whether genetic variations in four miRNA genes (miR-143 rs4705342, miR-122 rs17669, miR-126 rs4636297, and miR-124 rs531564) contribute to IS susceptibility. Methods: A case-control study was used to explore miRNA genetic polymorphisms in 567 IS patients and 552 control subjects that were frequency matched by age and gender. We genotyped four SNPs using polymerase chain reaction/ligation detection reaction. Results: The miR-126 gene rs4636297 polymorphism was associated with decreased small vessel stroke risk (GA vs. GG: odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.62, p\u2009=\u2009.015; GA\u2009+\u2009AA vs. GG: OR\u2009=\u20090.637, p\u2009=\u2009.018; A vs. G: OR\u2009=\u20090.696, p\u2009=\u2009.033).

To minimize risk, early biomarkers of such complications are of utmost importance. At the present time, microRNAs (miRNAs) are intensively studied as potential biomarkers of many pathological processes. Many miRNAs appear to be specific in some tissues, including the heart. In the present study we have explored the potential of specific miRNAs to be early markers of IMB-induced cardiotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (Dex) can confer cardioprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. While there are no studies addressing cardioprotection of Dex via regulation of microRNAs. The purpose of this study was to examine the roles and mechanisms of microRNA in cardioprotection of dexmedetomidine. METHODS: Rat heart Langendorff preparation was established. We assayed expression profiling of miRNAs in perfused rat hearts and predicted Target genes using MiRanda, MiRDB, and TargetScan. Oxide stress (H2O2) was employed to simulate I/R injury. miR-665 mimic, inhibitor, and siRNA of AK1 and Cnr2 were transfected to H9C2. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify miR-665 and Ak1 and Cnr2 mRNA. The apoptosis of the cells was examined. The expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, AK1, and Cnr2 were detected by Western blot. The combination between miR-665 and the 3'-untranslated region of AK1 and Cnr2 was validated by a luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Dex precondition down-regulated miR-665 expression in hearts compared to I/R group. Dex reduced miR-665 expression and apoptosis increased by oxide stress. However, up-regulation of miR-665 exacerbated the changes caused by oxide stress and inhibited the effects of Dex. Down-regulation of miR-665 also reduced apoptosis, but inhibition of AK1 and Cnr2 aggravated apoptosis. The luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-665 could down-regulate expression levels of AK1 and Cnr2.

Postprandial lipemia has many physiopathological effects, some of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be found in almost all biological fluids, but their postprandial kinetics are poorly described. We aimed to profile circulating miRNAs in response to a fat challenge. In total, 641 circulating miRNAs were assessed by real-time PCR in plasmas from mice two hours after lipid gavage. Mice with intestine-specific loss of Dicer were screened to identify potential miRNAs released by the intestine. A total of 68 miRNAs were selected for further validation. Ten circulating miRNAs were finally validated as responsive to postprandial lipemia, including miR-206-3p, miR-543-3p, miR-466c-5p, miR-27b-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-340-3p, miR-1941-3p, miR-10a-3p, miR-125a-3p, and miR-468-3p.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence of over 9000 people suggests that daily intake of vinegar whose principal bioactive component is acetic acid is associated with a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis. The underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unknown. METHODS: We examined the in vitro and in vivo anti-nephrolithiasis effects of vinegar and acetate. A randomized study was performed to confirm the effects of vinegar in humans. FINDINGS: We found individuals with daily consumption of vinegar compared to those without have a higher citrate and a lower calcium excretion in urine, two critical molecules for calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stone in humans. We observed that oral administration of vinegar or 5% acetate increased citrate and reduced calcium in urinary excretion, and finally suppressed renal CaOx crystal formation in a rat model. Mechanism dissection suggested that acetate enhanced acetylation of Histone H3 in renal tubular cells and promoted expression of microRNAs-130a-3p, -148b-3p and -374b-5p by increasing H3K9, H3K27 acetylation at their promoter regions. These miRNAs can suppress the expression of Nadc1 and Cldn14, thus enhancing urinary citrate excretion and reducing urinary calcium excretion. Significantly these mechanistic findings were confirmed in human kidney tissues, suggesting similar mechanistic relationships exist in humans. Results from a pilot clinical study indicated that daily intake of vinegar reduced stone recurrence, increased citrate and reduced calcium in urinary excretion in CaOx stone formers without adverse side effects. INTERPRETATION: Vinegar prevents renal CaOx crystal formation through influencing urinary citrate and calcium excretion via epigenetic regulations. Vinegar consumption is a promising strategy to prevent CaOx nephrolithiasis occurrence and recurrence.

Effective communication between the maternal reproductive tract, gametes and the pre-implantation embryo is essential for the successful establishment of pregnancy. Recent studies have recognised extracellular vesicles (EVs) as potent vehicles for intercellular communication, potentially via their transport of microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of the current investigation was to determine the size, concentration and electrical surface properties (zeta potential) of EVs secreted by; (1) primary cultures of porcine oviductal epithelial cells (POECs) from the isthmus and ampullary regions of the female reproductive tract; (2) Ishikawa and RL95-2 human endometrial epithelial cell line cultures; and (3) the non-reproductive epithelial cell line HEK293T. In addition, this study investigated whether EVs secreted by POECs contained miRNAs. All cell types were cultured in EV-depleted medium for 24 or 48\u202fh. EVs were successfully isolated from conditioned culture media using size exclusion chromatography. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was performed to evaluate EV size, concentration and zeta potential. QRT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression of candidate miRNAs (miR-103, let-7a, miR-19a, miR-203, miR-126, miR-19b, RNU44, miR-92, miR-196a, miR-326 and miR-23a). NTA confirmed the presence of EVs with diameters of 50-150\u202fnm in all cell types. EV size distribution was significantly different between cell types after 24 and 48\u202fh of cell culture and the concentration of EVs secreted by POECs and Ishikawa cells was also time dependent. The distribution of EVs with specific electrokinetic potential measurements varied between cell types, indicating that EVs of differing cellular origin have varied membrane components. In addition, EVs secreted by POECs exhibited significantly different time dependant changes in zeta potential. QRT-PCR confirmed the presence of miR-103, let-7a, miR-19a, miR-203, miR-126, and miR-19b in EVs secreted by POECs (CT\u202f\u2265\u202f29).

The present study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that may be crucial for the mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment in cisplatin\u2011induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and to investigate other potential drugs that may have a similar function. Transcriptomics (GSE85957) and miRNA expression (GSE66761) datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified using the linear models for microarray data method and mRNA targets of DEMs were predicted using the miRWalk2.0 database. The crucial DEGs were screened by constructing a protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis. Functions of target genes were analyzed using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery. Small molecule drugs were predicted using the connectivity map database. As a result, 5 DEMs were identified to be shared and oppositely expressed in comparisons between AKI model and control groups, and between MSC treatment and AKI model groups. The 103 DEGs were overlapped with the target genes of 5 common DEMs, and the resulting list was used for constructing the miRNA\u2011mRNA regulatory network, including rno\u2011miR\u2011210/Serpine1 and rno\u2011miR\u2011378/Fos. Serpine1 (degree=17) and Fos (degree=42) were predicted to be hub genes according to the topological characteristic of degree in the PPI network. Function analysis indicated Serpine1 and Fos may be inflammation\u2011related. Furthermore, gliclazide was suggested to be a potential drug for the treatment of AKI because the enrichment score was the closest to \u20111 (\u20110.9).

In this study, To discover the key microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) and their potential roles in the tumorigenesis of MTC, the microarray datasets GSE97070, GSE40807 and GSE27155 were analyzed. The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) were accessed by R. Targets of DEMs and predicted using starBase, and functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape. A protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) network and an analysis of modules were constructed using NetworkAnalyst. Finally, a network was constructed to show the regulatory association between transcription factors (TFs), DEMs and downstream genes. A total of 5 DEMs were found both in GSE97070 and GSE40807, including 3 upregulated DEMs and 2 downregulated DEMs. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses from Metascape revealed that the target genes of upregulated DEMs were significantly enriched in adherens junction, kinase and protein binding, while the target genes of downregulated DEMs were mainly involved in non\u2011canonical Wnt signaling pathway and RNA transport. From the PPI network, 13 nodes were screened as hub genes. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the top 5 modules were mostly enriched in the neurotrophin signaling pathway, mRNA surveillance pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, the TF\u2011DEMs\u2011target gene and DEGs regulatory network revealed that 17 TFs regulated 2 miRNAs, including upregulated or downregulated DEMs, CREB1 regulated all upregulated DEMs, and TGFB1 was an activator of hsa\u2011miR\u2011199a\u20113p and a repressor of hsa\u2011miR\u2011429.

{"text": "Identification of human herpes virus 1 encoded microRNAs in biopsy samples of lower esophageal sphincter muscle during peroral endoscopic myotomy for esophageal achalasia. Esophageal achalasia is a rare chronic debilitating disorder characterized by incomplete lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and abnormal peristalsis as a result of myenteric plexus degeneration. Although complex interactions among immunity, viruses and inheritance have been proposed, its causes remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRs) play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression during pathophysiological processes. Certain viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) encode miRs derived from their own genomes. To determine the underlying relationship of miRNAs to achalasia, we analyzed the expression profile of miRNAs using biopsy samples obtained from LES muscle during peroral endoscopic myotomy. Peroral LES muscle biopsy sampling was uneventfully carried out in our case series of achalasia. Control biopsy tissues were also obtained from LES muscle of patients without symptoms relating to abnormal esophageal motility whose esophagogastric junction was surgically excised. RNA was extracted from biopsy specimens and analyzed using a microarray. Differentially expressed miRNAs in achalasia patients compared to controls were identified and analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HSV-1-derived hsv1-miR-H1 and -H18 was significantly overexpressed in achalasia cohorts compared to controls. Correlations between the expression levels of viral miR and the patients' clinical characteristics including achalasia morphological type, dilatation grading, and disease duration were not identified.

In recent years, the importance of viral and host microRNAs (miRNAs) in mediating viral replication and control of host cellular machinery, has been realised and increasing efforts have been taken in order to understand the interactions of miRNAs from host and pathogen during infection. However, all existing studies has thus far been conducted in controlled experimental conditions and the veracity of these data for field conditions are yet to be established. In this framework, small RNA sequencing was performed to identify the miRNAs involved in shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) immune responses under two different WSSV infection conditions of natural infection and experimentally challenged conditions. The expression profiles of miRNAs of shrimp infected with WSSV under two contrasting conditions were compared and as a result, 23365 known miRNAs and 481 novel miRNAs were identified. Amongst the most abundantly expressed miRNAs, the hypoxia related miR-210 and immune pathway related miR-29b were expressed only in infected shrimps of both conditions. miR-8-5p, having a functional role in modulation of chitin biosynthesis was exclusively represented in higher numbers in the WSSV -infected shrimps under natural conditions whilst four of the miRNAs (mja-miR-6493-5p, mja-miR-6492, mmu-miR-3968, tcf-miR-9b-5p) identified from shrimps collected from pond culture targeted chitinase, an important enzyme involved in growth and moulting in shrimps, indicating an interaction between WSSV infection and moult cycle under culture conditions. Some of the miRNAs (tca-miR-87b-3p, cte-miR-277a) and miRNAs belonging to class miR-9, miR-981 that were identified only in WSSV infected shrimps under experimental conditions, are known to respond against WSSV infection in shrimps. Moreover, the miRNA target prediction revealed several immune-related gene targets such as cathepsin, c-type lectin, haemocyanin and ubiquitin protein ligase were commonly identified under both the conditions. However, the miRNAs identified from challenge experiment had wide number of gene targets as compared to the miRNAs of natural infection.

{"text": "Epigenetic mechanisms related to cognitive decline during aging. Cognitive decline is a hallmark of the aging nervous system, characterized by increasing memory loss and a deterioration of mental capacity, which in turn creates a favorable context for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most detrimental alterations that occur at the molecular level in the brain during aging is the modification of the epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression. As a result of these epigenetic-driven changes in the transcriptome most of the functions of the brain including synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory decline with aging. The epigenetic mechanisms altered during aging include DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome remodeling, and microRNA-mediated gene regulation. In this review, we examine the current evidence concerning the changes of epigenetic modifications together with the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired neuronal gene transcription during aging. Herein, we discuss the alterations of DNA methylation pattern that occur in old neurons. We will also describe the most prominent age-related histone posttranslational modifications in the brain since changes in acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues on H3 and H4 are associated to functional decline in the old. In addition, we discuss the role that changes in the levels of certain miRNAs would play in cognitive decline with aging.

AIM: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease with increased bone mass in the main sites of inflammation. Regulatory T (Treg) cells have been reported to involve in pathology of AS. This study designed at investigating the effects of nanocurcumin on Treg cell responses in peripheral blood (PB) of AS patients. METHODS: Test group including 12 AS patients received nanocurcumin daily for 4 months and control group including 12 patients received placebo. The frequency of Treg was measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of FoxP3 and several associated microRNAs (miRNAs; miR-27, miR-17, and miR-146a) and cytokines including Interleukin-10 (IL-10), TGF-\u03b2, and IL-6 were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was done to determine the secretion levels of cytokines. RESULTS: After treatment with nanocurcumin the frequency of Treg cells in AS patients increased significantly. The RT-PCR data indicated that the expression of miR-17 and miR-27 were significantly decreased following nanocurcumin treatment while miR-146a and FoxP3 were significantly increased. Moreover, nanocurcumin-treated group had high levels of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 and low levels of IL-6 production than control group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that dysregulation of Treg cells in PB influences the AS development and nanocurcumin therapy could regulate the Treg cells, and so could be useful in the treatment of AS and may be other autoimmune diseases.

Numbers of emerging evidence suggest that variable microRNA (miRNA) expression facilitates the aging process. In this study, we distinguished aberrant miRNA expression in aged skin and explored the biological functions and potential mechanism of upregulated miR-302b-3p. At first, miRNA microarray analysis was examined to explore miRNA expression profiling in the skin of aging mice model by D-galactose (d-gal) injection. We identified 29 aberrant miRNAs in aged mice skin. Next, KEGG enrichment analysis was conducted with DIANA-miPath v3.0, which was revealed that enrichment pathways involved in such processes as extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. The target genes of deregulated miRNAs were predicted from four bioinformatic algorithms (miRDB, Targetscan, miRwalk, and Tarbase). The interaction network of miRNAs and their targets were visualized using Cytoscape software. As a result, we found that some hub genes (including JNK2, AKT1/2/3, PAK7, TRPS1, BCL2L11, and IKZF2) were targeted by 12 potential miRNAs (including miR-302b-3p, miR-291a-5p, miR-139-3p, miR-467c-3p, miR-186-3p, etc.). Subsequently, we identified five upregulated miRNA via quantitative polymerase chain reaction and all of them were confirmed increased significantly in aged skin tissues compared with young control tissues. Among them, high expression of miR-302b-3p was verified in both aged skin tissues and senescence fibroblasts. Furthermore, miR-302b-3p mimic accelerated skin fibroblast senescence and suppressed the longevity-associated gene Sirtuin 1(Sirt1) expression, whereas miR-302b-3p inhibitor could delay skin fibroblast senescence and contribute Sirt1 expression. In addition, we demonstrated that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2(JNK2) is a direct target of miR-302b-3p by a luciferase reporter assay. An inverse correlation was verified in fibroblasts between miR-302b-3p and JNK2. Most importantly, siRNA JNK2 confirmed that low expression of JNK2 could accelerate fibroblasts senescence.

However, the influence of DCP1-DCP2 complex on DNA virus infection and the regulation of DCP1-DCP2 complex by microRNAs (miRNAs) remain unclear. In this study, the role of miRNA-regulated DCP1-DCP2 complex in DNA virus infection was characterized. Our results showed that the DCP1-DCP2 complex played a positive role in the infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a DNA virus of shrimp. In the DCP1-DCP2 complex, the N-terminal regulatory domain of DCP2 was interacted with the EVH1 domain of DCP1. Furthermore, shrimp miRNA miR-87 inhibited WSSV infection by targeting the host DCP2 gene and viral miRNA WSSV-miR-N46 took a negative effect on WSSV replication by targeting the host DCP1 gene. Therefore, our study provided novel insights into the underlying mechanism of DCP1-DCP2 complex and its regulation by miRNAs in virus-host interactions.

BACKGROUND: Many studies focusing on circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been published. However, a large number of circRNAs remain to be explored. This study was designed to discover new circRNAs and investigate their potential roles in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: A combination of gene chip analysis and bioinformatic methods was utilized to reveal new circRNAs and their possible mechanisms in PDAC. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established based on the results of differential analyses and interaction predictions. Promising drugs for treating PDAC were determined by connectivity map (CMap) analysis. RESULTS: Expression profile data were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and integration of differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) from two gene chips using the RobustRankAggreg method revealed 10 DECs. The microRNA (miRNA) response elements of these 10 DECs were predicted. The predicted miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs were intersected, and 12 overlapping miRNAs were acquired. Next, 2908 miRNA target mRNAs and 1187 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PDAC were identified and combined, revealing 118 overlapping mRNAs. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed with the 118 mRNAs, and four hub genes (CDH1, SERPINE1, IRS1 and FYN) were identified. Using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, survival analyses were conducted for the four hub genes, and SERPINE1 and FYN were found to be significantly associated with PDAC patient survival. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these four hub genes are closely associated with certain\u00a0cancer-related biological functions and pathways. In addition, CMap analysis based on the four hub genes was performed to screen potential therapeutic agents for PDAC, and three bioactive chemicals (celastrol, 5109870 and MG-132) were discovered.

It is well known that the acquisition of chemoresistance is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of human cancers. It is reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in chemotherapy resistance of various malignancies. miR-10b was previously proved as an oncogene in multiple malignancies, including esophageal cancer.

AIM: Hepatocytes can proliferate and regenerate when injured by toxins, viral infections, and so on. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a key regulator of liver regeneration, but the mechanism is unknown. The role of ALR in other cell types is not known. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between microRNA (miRNA)-26a and ALR in the Huh7 cell line and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal cells from chronic liver disease patients and healthy individuals. METHODS: Huh7 cells were transfected independently with ALR and miRNA-26a expression vectors, and their effects on cell proliferation, the expression of miRNA-26a, and activation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog and Akt signaling pathways were determined. The experiments were repeated on mesenchymal stem cells derived from healthy individuals and chronic liver disease patients to see whether the observations can be replicated in primary cells. RESULTS: Overexpression of ALR or miRNA-26a resulted in an increase of the phosphorylation of Akt and cyclin D1 expression, whereas it resulted in decreased levels of p-GSK-3\u03b2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog in Huh7 cells. The inhibition of ALR expression by ALR siRNA or anti-miR-26a decreased the Akt/cyclin\u00a0D1 signaling pathway, leading to decreased proliferation. Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from the chronic liver disease patients had a higher ALR expression, while the mesenchymal stem cells isolated from healthy volunteers responded to the growth factor treatments for increased ALR expression. It was found that there was a significant increase in miRNA-26a expression and proliferation.

We recruited 50 out of 350 MTC plasma samples (27 female and 23 male) which were selected based on RET mutation in exon 11 (25 RET-positive and 25 RET-negative), with a mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age of 37.04\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74 years. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to investigate the prognostic value of these miRNAs; although, they showed no significant prognostic value as MTC biomarkers in plasma samples.

This study investigated the role of microRNA-95 (miR-95) in gastric cancer (GC) and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Initially, bioinformatic prediction was used to predict the differentially expressed genes and related miRNAs in GC. miR-95 and DUSP5 expression was altered in GC cell line (MGC803) to evaluate their respective effects on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, cellular processes (cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis), cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype, as well as tumor growth ability. It was further predicted in bioinformatic prediction and verified in GC tissue and cell line experiments that miR-95 was highly expressed in GC. miR-95 negatively regulated DUSP5, which resulted in the MAPK pathway activation. Inhibited miR-95 or overexpressed DUSP5 was observed to inhibit the levels of CSC markers (CD133, CD44, ALDH1, and Lgr5), highlighting the inhibitory role in the CSC phenotype. More important, evidence was obtained demonstrating that miR-95 knockdown or DUSP5 upregulation exerted an inhibitory effect on the EMT process, cellular processes, and tumor growth.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is a fatal cancer in women, mainly due to its aggressive nature and poor survival rate.

Therefore, we explored the regulatory mechanism of WDFY3-AS2/miR-18a/RORA axis involved in the biological activities of OC cells. Microarray analysis predicted differentially expressed lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA related to OC, followed by investigating the relationship among them. The expression patterns of the identified lncRNA WDFY3-AS2, miR-18a, and RORA were measured in OC tissue and cells. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to characterize the effect of lncRNA WDFY3-AS2 on OC cells, as well as the involvement of miR-18a and RAR related orphan receptor A (RORA). The in vitro assays were validated by in vivo experiments. According to bioinformatics analysis, WDFY3-AS2 was speculated to affect OC by sponging miR-18a and modulating RORA. WDFY3-AS2 and RORA were underexpressed in OC, while miR-18a was highly expressed. Notably, WDFY3-AS2 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-18a and upregulate RORA. Upon overexpressing WDFY3-AS2 or inhibiting miR-18a, RORA expression was increased, thereby the OC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were suppressed, accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. In vivo experiments confirmed that the tumor growth was reduced in response to overexpressed WDFY3-AS2 or inhibited miR-18a.

Cellular miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators that could play a role in direct regulation of viral genes. Host miRNA expressions could either promote or repress viral replications. Induction of some cellular miRNAs could help the virus to evade the host immune response by suppressing the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling pathway while others could upregulate IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production and inhibit the viral infection. Understanding miRNA expressions and functions during dengue infections would provide insights into the development of miRNA-based therapeutics which could be strategized to act either as miRNA antagonists or miRNA mimics.

We have previously demonstrated that the antidepressant effect of ketamine is related to the abnormal expression of various miRNAs in the brain. This study determined the expression profile of circRNAs in the hippocampus of rats treated with ketamine. METHODS: The aberrantly expressed circRNAs in rat hippocampus after ketamine injection were analyzed by microarray chip, and we further validated these circRNAs by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The target genes of the different circRNAs were predicted using bioinformatic analyses, and the functions and signal pathways of these target genes were investigated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. RESULTS: Microarray analysis showed that five circRNAs were aberrantly expressed in rat hippocampus after ketamine injection (fold change >\u20092.0, p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and clustered, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Then the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory network were constructed and integratedly analyzed. Finally, modules from the integrated network were mined, and gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. DEGs in three clusters had the overall expression trend with the Thompson grades. The upregulated DEGs were associated with protein transport and localization, while the downregulated DEGs were enriched in membrane lipid metabolic process and endocytosis. After the integrated analysis of PPI and miRNA-target interactions, some hub genes such as HSP90B1, RPS4Y1, RPL15, and UTY, as well as hub miRNAs, including miR-124a and miR-506, were screened.

Identifying the interactions between disease and microRNA (miRNA) can accelerate drugs development, individualized diagnosis, and treatment for various human diseases.

But most previous studies have mainly focused on designing complicated similarity-based methods to predict latent interactions between miRNAs and diseases. In this study, we propose a novel computational model, termed heterogeneous graph convolutional network for miRNA-disease associations (HGCNMDA), which is based on known human protein-protein interaction (PPI) and integrates four biological networks: miRNA-disease, miRNA-gene, disease-gene, and PPI network. HGCNMDA achieved reliable performance using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). HGCNMDA is then compared to three state-of-the-art algorithms based on five-fold cross-validation. HGCNMDA achieves an AUC of 0.9626 and an average precision of 0.9660, respectively, which is ahead of other competitive algorithms. We further analyze the top-10 unknown interactions between miRNA and disease. In summary, HGCNMDA is a useful computational model for predicting miRNA-disease interactions.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 124}, "docId": "31455028", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 124, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 292, "charStart": 126}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 353, "charStart": 294}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 461, "charStart": 355}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 617, "charStart": 463}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 926, "charStart": 619}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1010, "charStart": 928}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1109, "charStart": 1012}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1241, "charStart": 1111}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1319, "charStart": 1243}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1414, "charStart": 1321}]}

Gastrokine1 (GKN1), important for maintaining the physiological function of the gastric mucosa, is highly expressed in the stomach of healthy individuals but is down-regulated or absent in gastric tumor tissues and derived cell lines. The mechanisms underlying GKN1 gene inactivation are still unknown. We previously showed that GKN1 downregulation in gastric tumors is likely associated with an epigenetic transcriptional complex that negatively regulates GKN1 expression. In addition, TSA-mediated inhibition of HDACs leads to GKN1 restoration at the transcriptional level, but no at the translational level. These findings led to hypothesize the activation of a second regulatory mechanism microRNAs-mediated, thus resulting in translational repression and gene silencing. Bioinformatic analyses performed with 5 different algorithms highlighted that 4 miRNAs contained a seed sequence for the 3'UTR of GKN1 mRNA. Among these, only two miRNAs, hsa-miR-544a and miR-1245b-3p directly target the GKN1-3'UTR as evaluated by luciferase reporter assays. TaqMan miRNA assay performed on gastric cancer cell lines after TSA treatment showed a stronger increase of miR-544a expression than that of miR-1245b-3p. Finally, co-transfection of AGS cells with GKN1-3'UTR and premiR-544a showed compared to controls, a strong reduction of GKN1 expression both at translational and transcriptional levels. The up-regulation of miR-544a could be crucially involved in the GKN1 translational repression, thus suggesting its potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target in GC patients.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-206 (miR-206) inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration in a variety of tumors, but the prognostic value of its Esophageal Cancer (EC) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To study the role of miR-206 in EC. METHODS: The datasets of RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, methylation, copy number variation (CNV), and clinical follow-up information were download from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After integration and standardization, the prognostic value and potential function of miR-206 were analyzed. The important roles of miR-206 expression in EC genetic and epigenetic mechanisms were analyzed by RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, and methylation data. The potential mechanism of CNV in different miR-206 expression groups was analyzed using GISTIC.

BACKGROUND (OBJECTIVE): In the development of tumor therapy, the role of long non-coding RNA actin filagenin 1 antisense RNA 1 (1ncRNA AFAP1-AS1) is quite significant, but the actual role of AFAP1-AS1 in the treatment of prostate cancer has not been determined. In view of this, the author took AFAP1-AS1 as the research object to design an experimental study, and conducted an in-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. METHODS: RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of AFAP1-AS1 and miR-512-3p in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Perforation, flow cytometry and CCK-8 were used to detect the effects of cell proliferation, migration and invasion of mir-512-3p and a AFAP1-AS1. And the luciferase reporter gene was used to detect the downstream target gene of AFAP1-AS1, and the expression of CDK4, CDK6 and CCND1 protein was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: AFAP1-AS1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. The expression level of AFAP1-AS1 is correlated with histological grade and distant metastasis. The overall level of patients with high expression of AFAP1-AS1 is low, and their survival rate is relatively low. Silencing AFAP1-AS1 can significantly increase the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells. AFAP1-AS1 silencing induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. The downstream target of AFAP1-AS1 was mir-512-3p. The role of AFAP1-AS1 in the progression of prostate cancer cells was mediated by mir-512-3p. CONCLUSION: AFAP1-AS1 regulates miR-512-3p, so as to realize the regulation effect on the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells, and thereby promote the occurrence and development of prostate cancer, so as to provide the corresponding program for the treatment of prostate cancer.

{"text": "miR-140-5p is negatively correlated with proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in malignant melanoma by targeting SOX4 via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB cascades. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated as critical regulators in the development of melanoma. miR-140 was abnormally downregulated in uveal melanoma samples. However, the expression level and roles of miR-140-5p remain unclear in melanoma for now. We speculate that miR-140-5p is abnormally expressed and may play an important role in melanoma. The expressions of miR-140-5p and SOX4 messenger RNA were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Western blot assays were employed to detect the expression levels of SOX4, Ki67, MMP-2, MMP-7, p-\u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, cyclin D1, p65, and I\u03baB\u03b1. Luciferase reporter assays were employed to elucidate the interaction between SOX4 and miR-140-5p. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) and transwell invasion assays were applied to evaluate capabilities of cell proliferation and invasion, respectively. Xenograft models of melanoma were established to verify the role and molecular basis of miR-140-5p. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were employed to measure the Ki67 and SOX4 at the protein level in xenografted melanoma tissues. Herein, these observations showed that, miR-140-5p was abnormally downregulated in melanoma tissues and cells, while SOX4 was upregulated. miR-140-5p directly targeted SOX4 and inhibited its expression in melanoma cells. miR-140-5p overexpression repressed melanoma cell proliferation and invasion and its effects were partially restored SOX4 overexpression. Moreover, miR-140-5p hindered melanoma growth in vivo by downregulating SOX4. Mechanistically, miR-140-5p suppressed activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB pathways by targeting SOX4. Our study concluded that miR-140-5p hindered cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis by targeting SOX4 via inactivation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in malignant melanoma, which provides an underlying molecular mechanism for the treatment for melanoma with miRNAs.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 164}, "docId": "31385607", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 164, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 258, "charStart": 166}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 322, "charStart": 260}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 412, "charStart": 324}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 509, "charStart": 414}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 638, "charStart": 511}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 779, "charStart": 640}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 878, "charStart": 781}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1067, "charStart": 880}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1167, "charStart": 1069}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1297, "charStart": 1169}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1436, "charStart": 1299}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1518, "charStart": 1438}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1656, "charStart": 1520}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 1734, "charStart": 1658}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 1843, "charStart": 1736}, {"index": 16, "charEnd": 2137, "charStart": 1845}]}

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is an anion exchanger expressed at the hepatocyte sinusoidal membrane, which mediates the uptake of several endogenous metabolites and drugs. OATP1B1 expression level and activity are major sources of inter-patient variability of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of several drugs. Besides the genotype, factors that contribute to the inter-individual variability in OATP1B1 expression level are practically unknown. The aim of this work was to uncover novel epigenetic mechanisms of OATP1B1 regulation. METHODS: A functional screening strategy to assess the effect of microRNAs on the uptake of estrone-3-sulphate, an OATP1B1 substrate, into human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells was used. microRNA-206 (miR-206) expression in human liver tissues was measured by real-time RT-PCR. OATP1B1 expression in Huh-7 and in human liver tissues was assessed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunostaining. The mRNA-miRNA interaction was assessed by reporter assay. RESULTS: miR-206 mimic repressed mRNA and protein expression of OATP1B1 in Huh-7 cells. The intracellular accumulation of estrone-3-sulphate was reduced by 30% in cells overexpressing miR-206. The repressive effect of miR-206 on the activity of the firefly luciferase gene 2 under the control of the OATP1B1 3' untranslated region was lost upon deletion of the predicted miR-206 binding site.

Upregulation of miR-496 related to a significant reduction in apoptosis of H9c2 and human cardiomyocytes treatment with H/R. Moreover, transfection of H9c2 cells with miR-496 mimics, which were pretreated with H/R for 12\u2009hours, increased Ki67 levels, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Bcl-2 proteins; and decreased cleaved caspase-3 and Bax protein levels, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays. A dual-luciferase reporter system confirmed that miR-496 targets the Hook3 suppressor. Hook3 overexpression stimulated apoptosis in H/R-treated cells, thus reducing cell proliferation. Upregulated miR-496 activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling, while Hook3 exhibited the inverse trend in H/R-treated H9c2 cells. In summary, with Hook3 functionality's aid, miR-496 upregulation defends cells from H/R-induced apoptosis and stimulates cell proliferation. miR-496 targets Hook3 to trigger the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway for antiapoptotic and proliferative effects.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 137}, "docId": "31436348", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 137, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 308, "charStart": 139}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 504, "charStart": 310}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 611, "charStart": 506}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 830, "charStart": 613}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 955, "charStart": 832}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1282, "charStart": 957}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1369, "charStart": 1284}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1467, "charStart": 1371}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1668, "charStart": 1469}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1809, "charStart": 1670}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1923, "charStart": 1811}]}

Dendritic cells (DCs) are key components of the immune system, serving as antigen-presenting cells to activate adaptive immunity. Whereas mature DCs promote immune responses, immature DCs induce or maintain immunological tolerance by downregulating T-cell responses. Therefore, DCs are potent antigen (Ag)-presenting cells in the immune system. MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate mRNA by binding the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of these molecules, modulating their expression. Many recent studies have suggested a potential role of miRNAs in DCs maturation and differentiation, but the exact mechanisms governing this process are unclear. How and whether miR-199a-3p affects DC maturation has not been investigated. Here, we found that MiR-199a-3p levels are correlated with DC maturation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activity. In addition, we analyzed the stimulation of regulatory T-cells by DCs. Through this work, we determined CD86 to be targeted by miR-199a-3p, thereby linking it to DC maturation. miR-199a-3p therefore directly inhibits CD86 expression via 3'-UTR targeting, subsequently prolonging allograft survival in a mouse heart transplantation model. miR-199a-3p over-expression may therefore be a potential therapeutic strategy for use in organ transplantation or patients with autoimmune diseases.", "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 109}, "docId": "31448543", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 109, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 239, "charStart": 111}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 376, "charStart": 241}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 454, "charStart": 378}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 617, "charStart": 456}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 779, "charStart": 619}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 856, "charStart": 781}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1010, "charStart": 858}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1081, "charStart": 1012}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1187, "charStart": 1083}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1348, "charStart": 1189}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1497, "charStart": 1350}]}

Adult human mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to differentiate into osteoblast, which plays crucial roles in bone regeneration and repair. Some transcriptional factors (TFs), such as BMP-2 and RUNX2, have been demonstrated to control the differentiation processes. It is important to discover more key regulators in osteoblast differentiation. Recently, some studies found long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participating in osteoblast differentiation, such as MALAT1, DANCR, and ANCR. In this study, we performed a network-based computational analysis to investigate the lncRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) crosstalks via integrating microRNA (miRNA)-RNA interactions, gene coexpression, and protein-protein interactions. First, multiple topology analyses were performed to osteoblast-differentiation-related lncRNA-mRNA network (ODLMN). Several lncRNAs with central topology structures were identified as key regulators. Results showed that these lncRNAs participated in osteoblast differentiation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Ras signals. Previous studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs exert functions by involving in close modules. Second, after performing module searching in ODLMN, two functional modules were identified, which played crucial roles through involving in PI3K/protein kinase B, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 pathways. Third, a subset of core lncRNA-TF crosstalks that might form feedback loops to control the biological processes in osteoblast differentiation was identified.

METHODS: The serum of 30 HPV16 positive (HPV16Pos) and 30 negative patients (HPV16Neg) was collected and then the differentially expressed miRNAs were screened out by function and pathway enrichment analyses. Next, the cervical cancer cells were cultured. miR-5701-mimic and inhibitor were transfected into cells. The level of miR-5701 was detected by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation of cells was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of THBS4.

Herein, we conducted this study to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and then to investigate the potential roles of these miRNAs in OBI. Plasma miRNA expression profiles of three OBI patients and three healthy controls were analyzed with high through-put miRNA sequencing technology. Altered expression of miRNAs was further confirmed with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

{"text": "Expression of selected angiogenesis-related small microRNAs in patients with abnormally increased secretion of glucocorticoids. INTRODUCTION: Higher cortisol levels are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly, partially resulting from biologic effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) on endothelial cells observed in an experimental setting. These features are replicated in patients with endogenous GC excess (Cushing's syndrome) or with exogenous hypercortisolism due to excessive pharmacological application of GCs. Both groups present also an increased cardiovascular disease event rate. GCs may also adversely influence recovery after myocardial infarction. Recently it was proposed that microRNAs (miRNAs) - small noncoding RNAs functioning as antisense regulators of gene expression by targeting mRNA - may have a central role in regulating endothelial function through multiple mechanisms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic GC excess on the expression of selected endothelium-controlling miRNAs expressed in nucleated cells circulating in peripheral blood (PBNCs) of patients with endogenous hypercortisolism either due to corticotrophin-independent or corticotrophin-dependent Cushing's syndrome (CS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood nuclear cells were collected from 35 healthy subjects and 31 patients with endogenous hypercortisolism as a source of miRNAs. A self-validated individual quantitative RT-PCR study was then performed to evaluate the expression levels of selected miRNAs in PBNCs. Additionally, endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in peripheral blood was assessed with respect to endothelial dysfunction using Western blotting. RESULTS: The ET-1 expression levels in CS were higher than in controls, confirming endothelial dysfunction in the CS group. Furthermore, miRNA analysis revealed a significantly decreased intracellular expression of selected endothelium-related miRNAs in patients with endogenous hypercortisolism, including miRNA-17-5p, miRNA-126-3p, and miRNA-126-5p, compared to controls. In contrast, two other angiogenic miRNAs, miRNA-150-5p and miRNA-223-3p, were significantly upregulated compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular events related to hypercortisolism remain a challenging problem in medical practice. This study has demonstrated that the chronic excess of GCs in endogenous CS might induce significant dysregulation of selected miRNAs involved in the control of endothelium biology. However, the lack of knowledge about specific miRNA expression postpones the full understanding of the biological roles of such miRNAs in hypercortisolism.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of PI on selected miRNAs during storage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a pool and split strategy, 3 identical buffy coat PC units were generated from a pool of 24 whole blood donors. Each unit received a different treatment: 1) Untreated platelet control in platelet additive solution (C-PAS); 2) Amotosalen-UVA-treated platelets in PAS (PI-PAS); and 3) untreated platelets in donor plasma (U-PL).

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is known worldwide as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases, prospectively leading to hospitalization coupled with increasing incidence. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be potential biomarkers for pancreatitis. In this study, we verified the hypothesis that miR-92a-3p is implicated in the development of AP by controlling the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) through the modulation of the Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and inflammatory factors in rats. Initially, we established a rat model of AP and extracted the pancreatic tissues. Then, the positive rate of KLF2 was measured using immunohistochemistry, and the expression of the related genes was determined by rReverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay and flow cytometry, and the contents of inflammatory factors were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. AP rats presented with increased miR-92a-3p expression as well as decreased KLF2 expression in PACs.

MicroRNA-520e (miR-520e) is increasingly being recognized as a cancer-related miRNA in multiple cancer types; however, little is known about its role in colorectal cancer. In this study, we determined the specific role of miR-520e in colorectal cancer. Expression of miR-520e was lower in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Overexpression of miR-520e significantly decreased the proliferation, colony formation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, while inhibition of miR-520e exhibited the opposite effect. Moreover, miR-520e was found to target the 3'-untranslated region of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and inhibit AEG-1 expression in colorectal cancer cells. An inverse correlation between miR-520e and AEG-1 expression was confirmed in colorectal cancer tissues.

CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dysregulation of miRNAs might be involved in the underlying pathophysiology of BD through several biological pathways; and highlight the importance of the exosomal miRNAs for biomarker research in BD.

Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with high neonatal mortality and permanent neurologic deficit. Recent data suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) may have essential functions in the regulation of HIE. This study aims to investigate the functional role of miR-499-5p and the underlying mechanism in regulating neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting assay were performed to investigate the relationship between miR-499-5p and C-reactive protein (CRP). TUNEL staining assay was applied to evaluate neuronal cell apoptosis in the hippocampus after administration of miR-499-5p in HIE rat model. Neurobehavioral assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of miR-499-5p on the neurological functions of rat pups with HI-induced brain injury. Our study showed that miR-499-5p regulated CRP expression in L-02 cells and rat HIE model. The miR-499-5p treatment resulted in significant reduction of neuronal cell apoptosis and the infarct size of the brain. Furthermore, administration of miR-499-5p significantly improved spatial learning ability, spatial memory, and locomotor function of rat pups with HIE.

The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays an important role in the metabolism and homeostasis of cholesterol, lipids, bile acids, and steroid hormones. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently recognized important negative regulators of gene expression. In this report, we showed that miRNA hsa-miR-613 played an important role in the autoregulation of the human LXR\u03b1 gene. hsa-miR-613 targeted the endogenous LXR\u03b1 through its specific miRNA response element (613MRE) within the LXR\u03b1 3'-untranslated region. Interestingly and paradoxically, the expression of hsa-miR-613 itself was induced upon the activation of LXR. However, hsa-miR-613 did not appear to be a direct LXR target gene. Instead, the positive regulation of hsa-miR-613 by LXR was mediated by the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a known LXR target gene. Promoter analysis revealed an SREBP response element in the hsa-miR-613 gene promoter. Treatment with insulin also induced the expression of hsa-miR-613 in an SREBP-1c-dependent manner, further supporting the role of SREBP-1c in the positive regulation of this miRNA species. Finally, the autoinduction of LXR\u03b1 by a LXR agonist was enhanced when hsa-miR-613 was inhibited or SREBP-1c was down-regulated. hsa-miR-613 appeared to specifically target the human LXR\u03b1. We propose that the negative regulation mediated by hsa-miR-613 and SREBP-1c and the previously reported positive regulation mediated by an LXR response element in the LXR\u03b1 gene promoter constitute a ying-yang mechanism to ensure a tight regulation of this nuclear receptor of many metabolic functions.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 100, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 308, "charStart": 102}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 401, "charStart": 310}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 521, "charStart": 403}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 655, "charStart": 523}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 765, "charStart": 657}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 833, "charStart": 767}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 987, "charStart": 835}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1074, "charStart": 989}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1263, "charStart": 1076}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1391, "charStart": 1265}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1451, "charStart": 1393}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1754, "charStart": 1453}], "mesh": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "Blotting, Western", "Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay", "Feedback, Physiological", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Silencing", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Insulin", "Liver X Receptors", "MicroRNAs", "Orphan Nuclear Receptors", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Response Elements", "Signal Transduction", "Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including cell specification, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. In lens, both these systems control lens fiber cell differentiation; however, a possible link between these processes remains to be examined. Herein, the functional requirement for miRNAs in differentiating lens fiber cells was demonstrated via conditional inactivation of Dicer1 in mouse (Mus musculus) lens. To dissect the miRNA-dependent pathways during lens differentiation, we used a rat (Rattus norvegicus) lens epithelial explant system, induced by FGF2 to differentiate, followed by mRNA and miRNA expression profiling. Transcriptome and miRNome analysis identified extensive FGF2-regulated cellular responses that were both independent and dependent on miRNAs. We identified 131 FGF2-regulated miRNAs. Seventy-six of these miRNAs had at least two in silico predicted and inversely regulated target mRNAs. Genes modulated by the greatest number of FGF-regulated miRNAs include DNA-binding transcription factors Nfib, Nfat5/OREBP, c-Maf, Ets1, and N-Myc. Activated FGF signaling influenced bone morphogenetic factor/transforming growth factor-\u03b2, Notch, and Wnt signaling cascades implicated earlier in lens differentiation. Specific miRNA:mRNA interaction networks were predicted for c-Maf, N-Myc, and Nfib (DNA-binding transcription factors); Cnot6, Cpsf6, Dicer1, and Tnrc6b (RNA to miRNA processing); and Ash1l, Med1/PBP, and Kdm5b/Jarid1b/Plu1 (chromatin remodeling). Three miRNAs, including miR-143, miR-155, and miR-301a, down-regulated expression of c-Maf in the 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assays.
