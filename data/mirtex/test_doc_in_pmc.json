This is particularly relevant in cancer, as the presence of a stem-cell niche is thought to contribute to the limitless replicative potential of a tumour, as well as restoring growth of lesions that arise from therapy relapse. In haematological malignancies, for instance, acetyl-CoA is an obligate cofactor for CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, which activates the transcription factor c-Myb and induces the expression of the self-renewal genes Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and CSF1R. The regulation of acetyl-CoA metabolic pathways also contributes to disease progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), with oncogenic KRAS mutations co-operating with ACLY and ACSS2 activity to promote proliferation and metastasis. Acetyl-CoA-induced epigenetic remodelling in PDA creates a histone profile reminiscent of the foregut endoderm in the developing embryo, and is characterised by a transcriptional programme consisting of upregulation of pro-survival and metastatic genes, including FOXA1, GATA5 and Sox2. Interestingly, metabolic crosstalk between ACLY\u2013ACSS2 and the mevalonate pathway has also been observed in PDA, with acetyl-CoA serving as the predominant substrate for cholesterol and steroid synthesis. The metabolic products of the mevalonate pathway have well-characterised roles not only in the post-translational modification of oncogenes, including the farnesylation of Ras, but also on the epigenetic landscape through regulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Importantly, inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with statins facilitates widespread effects on microRNA (miRNA) expression, reduced transcription of genes involved in folate metabolism such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as well as attenuation of HDAC activity leading to CDKN1A promoter acetylation and transcription of the tumour suppressor p21.", "article_type": "review-article", "sec_type": "other", "pmid": "31819192", "type": "P", "id": 41, "pmcid": "PMC6964678"}

In cancer patients, a proportion of cfDNA will comprise ctDNA. The amount of ctDNA varies and is thought to reflect the burden of disease, with greater amounts of ctDNA present in more advanced/late-stage patients. ctDNA might carry tumour-specific mutations, reflecting the mutational landscape of the primary tumour, and therefore represents an important means by which to sample tumour tissue non-invasively.

The unexpected induction of defensin 3 and thaumatin in response to starvation is in agreement with the recently discovered expression of antimicrobial peptides in food-deprived Drosophila melanogaster. The nuclear transcription factor FOXO, a key regulator of stress resistance, metabolism and ageing, has been attributed to mediate AMP expression in response to starvation in this model insect [12].

At least HSP90 is known to function as a chaperon and to play a role in oogenesis [5]. In sum, our real-time PCR-based approach provides evidence for differential- and gender-specific expression of immune- and stress-related genes upon exposure to environmental stressors.

Background: Recent studies illuminated a novel role of microRNA (miRNA) in the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction: two genes (ceRNAs) can achieve coexpression by competing for a pool of common targeting miRNAs. Individual biological investigations implied ceRNA interaction performs crucial oncogenic/tumor suppressive functions in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Yet, a systematic analysis has not been conducted to explore the functional landscape and prognostic significance of ceRNA interaction. Results: Incorporating the knowledge that ceRNA interaction is highly condition-specific and modulated by the expressional abundance of miRNAs, we devised a ceRNA inference by differential correlation analysis to identify the miRNA-modulated ceRNA pairs. Analyzing sample-paired miRNA and gene expression profiles of GBM, our data showed that this alternative layer of gene interaction is essential in global information flow. Functional annotation analysis revealed its involvement in activated processes in brain, such as synaptic transmission, as well as critical tumor-associated functions. Notably, a systematic survival analysis suggested the strength of ceRNA-ceRNA interactions, rather than expressional abundance of individual ceRNAs, among three immune response genes (CCL22, IL2RB, and IRF4) is predictive of patient survival. The prognostic value was validated in two independent cohorts.

Recently, an alternative role of miRNA as a \u201cbridge\u201d of gene interaction, namely the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction, was proposed and verified using in vitro and in vivo models [5\u20137]. In the scenario of ceRNA interaction, genes (ceRNAs) achieve coexpression by competing for a common pool of targeting miRNAs (acting as sponges; illustrated in Fig.\u00a01a). ceRNA interaction has been shown to play essential roles in the development and progression of cancers, and to potentially serve as new therapeutic targets [8\u201310]. Recent studies also revealed its role in propagating the effects of alterations in 3\u2032 untranslated regions of genes, including single nucleotide polymorphisms and alternative polyadenylation [11\u201313]. Strength of such miRNA-mediated gene crosstalk can even outperform the one achieved by direct transcriptional regulation [14]. In vitro and in silico investigations suggest that a balance among miRNA and ceRNA abundance and targeting affinities is essential for optimal ceRNA interaction [15\u201319]. Taking into consideration the variations from high-throughput profiling (probe sensitivity, heterogeneity and variations of sampled cohorts, etc.), ceRNA interaction appears to be modulated by (i.e., dependent on) the expression of bridging miRNAs [7, 20, 21] (illustrated in Fig.\u00a01b). In other words, coexpression between a pair of ceRNAs (ce-pair) is optimized when its bridging miRNA is expressed within a certain range (Fig.\u00a01b, right panel), suggesting the necessity to consider miRNA modulation in a systematic screening of ceRNA interaction.\n", "article_type": "research-article", "sec_type": "background", "pmid": "28241741", "type": "P", "id": 2, "pmcid": "PMC5330036"}

NB-fit and VST appear to be more robust than CP-fit for estimating and testing the heritability scores, while NB-fit is the most computationally expensive. CP-fit performed best in terms of the coverage of the confidence intervals. In addition, we applied the methods to both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing datasets from a recombinant inbred mouse panel. We show that miRNA and mRNA expression can be a highly heritable molecular trait in mouse, and that some top heritable features coincide with expression quantitative trait loci. Conclusions: The models and methods we investigated in this manuscript is applicable and extendable to sequencing experiments where some biological replicates are available and the environmental variation is properly controlled. The CP-fit approach for assessing heritability was implemented for the first time to our knowledge. All the methods presented, as well as the generation of simulated sequencing data under either negative binomial or compound Poisson mixed models, are provided in the R package HeritSeq.

Background: Post-transcriptional gene dysregulation can be a hallmark of diseases like cancer and microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in the modulation of translation efficiency. Known pre-miRNAs are listed in miRBase, and they have been discovered in a variety of organisms ranging from viruses and microbes to eukaryotic organisms. The computational detection of pre-miRNAs is of great interest, and such approaches usually employ machine learning to discriminate between miRNAs and other sequences. Many features have been proposed describing pre-miRNAs, and we have previously introduced the use of sequence motifs and k-mers as useful ones. There have been reports of xeno-miRNAs detected via next generation sequencing. However, they may be contaminations and to aid that important decision-making process, we aimed to establish a means to differentiate pre-miRNAs from different species. Results: To achieve distinction into species, we used one species\u2019 pre-miRNAs as the positive and another species\u2019 pre-miRNAs as the negative training and test data for the establishment of machine learned models based on sequence motifs and k-mers as features. This approach resulted in higher accuracy values between distantly related species while species with closer relation produced lower accuracy values. Conclusions: We were able to differentiate among species with increasing success when the evolutionary distance increases. This conclusion is supported by previous reports of fast evolutionary changes in miRNAs since even in relatively closely related species a fairly good discrimination was possible.

This regulation mechanism exists in a wide range of species like viruses [3] and plants [4]. Although the plant miRNA pathway is said to have evolved independently of the metazoan one [5], the secondary pre-miRNA structures appear to be similar when visually inspected on miRBase [6] which houses known pre-miRNAs and their mature miRNAs. Release 21 of miRBase contains 28,645 mature miRNAs (2588 for human), but the existence of many more miRNAs can be expected [7]. The experimental detection of miRNAs is, however, convoluted by the fact that they can only convey function when co-expressed with their target mRNAs [8]. Therefore, and since it seems futile to try and discover all miRNAs of an organism experimentally, computational prediction of miRNAs has become important.

The purpose of the present study was to differentiate pre-miRNAs between two species. That means both positive and negative classes for training were derived from known pre-miRNAs which removed the need to employ pseudo negative data. This approach is viable for miRNAs because fast evolution has been shown to exist for them before [18\u201320] so that given larger evolutionary distances at least the miRNA sequences should deviate enough to allow discrimination. Hence, we focused on sequence-based features and motifs to achieve proper discrimination. Previously, Ding et al. used n-grams (same as our k-mers) to create miRNA families [21], which was a similar intention but from a different perspective. Ding et al. tried to solve the multi-class problem of assigning an unknown miRNA to its correct miRNA family which does not represent a species but the membership of a miRNA to a family of miRNAs which consists of miRNAs from different species, which are evolutionary conserved. Lopes et al. also attempted to discriminate between species [22], but used the same synthetic negative data that is generally used in pre-miRNA detection methods [23\u201326] and employed the same training and testing strategies as other approaches [16, 27\u201329]. They further focused on structural features which we found not to be useful for discriminating between closely related species since the structure is generally more conserved than sequence composition. An important contribution of the present work is that it overcomes the use of arbitrary negative examples of unknown quality by using the data of one species for positive examples and the data of the other species for negative examples and vice versa. In summary, one of the purposes of the present study was to discriminate between two species using pre-microRNAs. Additionally, we aimed to establish a range for evolutionary distance at which differentiation into species can be achieved. We were able to show that discrimination among hominids is fairly impossible while the comparison between, for example, human and worms is straightforward. In the future, pre-miRNA classification strategy which can assign an unknown pre-miRNA to the most likely species of origin may be developed, which will be important in studies depending on deep sequencing data which often contain contaminating sequences [30].", "article_type": "research-article", "sec_type": "introduction", "pmid": "28292266", "type": "P", "id": 4, "pmcid": "PMC5351198"}

Both targets lead to comparable results (Table\u00a03), thereby confirming the viability of this approach. In conclusion, we show that a classifier can differentiate between pre-microRNAs from different species using a combined motif and k-mer signature. In future studies, this may lead to the ability to classify unknown pre-miRNAs into their correct category which is important when attempting studies involving xeno-miRNAs in order to separate interesting results from contamination. To achieve that end, models for all known pairs of species need to be established. Applying all models to an unknown example then creates a fingerprint for that example. After that multi-class classification or clustering (self-organizing maps, nearest neighbor, etc.) can be applied to determine class/cluster membership of the unknown example. This approach would use the distance information of all trained species models and would be much more powerful than applying multi-class classification or clustering directly to the examples.

Background: Genome-wide miRNA expression data can be used to study miRNA dysregulation comprehensively. Although many open-source tools for microRNA (miRNA)-seq data analyses are available, challenges remain in accurate miRNA quantification from large-scale miRNA-seq dataset. We implemented a pipeline called QuickMIRSeq for accurate quantification of known miRNAs and miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) from multiple samples simultaneously. Results: QuickMIRSeq considers the unique nature of miRNAs and combines many important features into its implementation. First, it takes advantage of high redundancy of miRNA reads and introduces joint mapping of multiple samples to reduce computational time. Second, it incorporates the strand information in the alignment step for more accurate quantification. Third, reads potentially arising from background noise are filtered out to improve the reliability of miRNA detection. Fourth, sequences aligned to miRNAs with mismatches are remapped to a reference genome to further reduce false positives. Finally, QuickMIRSeq generates a rich set of QC metrics and publication-ready plots. Conclusions: The rich visualization features implemented allow end users to interactively explore the results and gain more insights into miRNA-seq data analyses.

Background: MicroRNA (miRNA) sponges with multiple tandem miRNA binding sequences can sequester miRNAs from their endogenous target mRNAs. Therefore, miRNA sponge acting as a decoy is extremely important for long-term loss-of-function studies both in vivo and in silico. Recently, a growing number of in silico methods have been used as an effective technique to generate hypotheses for in vivo methods for studying the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNA sponges. However, most existing in silico methods only focus on studying miRNA sponge interactions or networks in cancer, the module-level properties of miRNA sponges in cancer is still largely unknown. Results: We propose a novel in silico method, called miRSM (miRNA Sponge Module) to infer miRNA sponge modules in breast cancer. We apply miRSM to the breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) dataset provided by The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), and make functional validation of the computational results. We discover that most miRNA sponge interactions are module-conserved across two modules, and a minority of miRNA sponge interactions are module-specific, existing only in a single module. Through functional annotation and differential expression analysis, we also find that the modules discovered using miRSM are functional miRNA sponge modules associated with BRCA. Moreover, the module-specific miRNA sponge interactions among miRNA sponge modules may be involved in the progression and development of BRCA. Our experimental results show that miRSM is comparable to the benchmark methods in recovering experimentally confirmed miRNA sponge interactions, and miRSM outperforms the benchmark methods in identifying interactions that are related to breast cancer. Conclusions: Altogether, the functional validation results demonstrate that miRSM is a promising method to identify miRNA sponge modules and interactions, and may provide new insights for understanding the roles of miRNA sponges in cancer progression and development.

Background: Recent studies have shown that the crosstalk between microRNA (miRNA) sponges plays an important role in human cancers. However, the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are still unknown. Results: In this study, we propose a multi-step method called miRSCoPPI to infer miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs. We focus on investigating breast cancer (BRCA) related miRNA sponge co-regulation, by integrating heterogeneous data, including miRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, PPIs and lncRNA-target interactions, and the list of breast cancer genes. We find that the inferred BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network is highly connected and scale free. The top 10% hub genes in the BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network have potential biological implications in breast cancer. By utilizing a graph clustering method, we discover 17 BRCA-related miRSCoPPI modules. Through pathway enrichment analysis of the modules, we find that several modules are significantly enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer. Moreover, 10 modules have good performance in classifying breast tumor and normal samples, and can act as module signatures for prognostication. By using putative computationally predicted miRNA-target interactions, we have consistent results with those obtained using experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, indicating that miRSCoPPI is robust in inferring miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs in human breast cancer. Conclusions: Taken together, the results demonstrate that miRSCoPPI is a promising tool for inferring BRCA-related miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs and it can help with the understanding of the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges on the PPIs.

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with poor prognosis. Studies have showed that abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression can affect CRC pathogenesis and development through targeting critical genes in cellular system. However, it is unclear about which miRNAs play central roles in CRC\u2019s pathogenesis and how they interact with transcription factors (TFs) to regulate the cancer-related genes. Results: To address this issue, we systematically explored the major regulation motifs, namely feed-forward loops (FFLs), that consist of miRNAs, TFs and CRC-related genes through the construction of a miRNA-TF regulatory network in CRC. First, we compiled CRC-related miRNAs, CRC-related genes, and human TFs from multiple data sources. Second, we identified 13,123 3-node FFLs including 25 miRNA-FFLs, 13,005 TF-FFLs and 93 composite-FFLs, and merged the 3-node FFLs to construct a CRC-related regulatory network. The network consists of three types of regulatory subnetworks (SNWs): miRNA-SNW, TF-SNW, and composite-SNW. To enhance the accuracy of the network, the results were filtered by using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expression data in CRC, whereby we generated a core regulatory network consisting of 58 significant FFLs. We then applied a hub identification strategy to the significant FFLs and found 5 significant components, including two miRNAs (hsa-miR-25 and hsa-miR-31), two genes (ADAMTSL3 and AXIN1) and one TF (BRCA1). The follow up prognosis analysis indicated all of the 5 significant components having good prediction of overall survival of CRC patients. Conclusions: In summary, we generated a CRC-specific miRNA-TF regulatory network, which is helpful to understand the complex CRC regulatory mechanisms and guide clinical treatment. The discovered 5 regulators might have critical roles in CRC pathogenesis and warrant future investigation.

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in pathological initiation, progression and maintenance. Because identification in the laboratory of disease-related miRNAs is not straightforward, numerous network-based methods have been developed to predict novel miRNAs in silico. Homogeneous networks (in which every node is a miRNA) based on the targets shared between miRNAs have been widely used to predict their role in disease phenotypes. Although such homogeneous networks can predict potential disease-associated miRNAs, they do not consider the roles of the target genes of the miRNAs. Here, we introduce a novel method based on a heterogeneous network that not only considers miRNAs but also the corresponding target genes in the network model. Results: Instead of constructing homogeneous miRNA networks, we built heterogeneous miRNA networks consisting of both miRNAs and their target genes, using databases of known miRNA-target gene interactions. In addition, as recent studies demonstrated reciprocal regulatory relations between miRNAs and their target genes, we considered these heterogeneous miRNA networks to be undirected, assuming mutual miRNA-target interactions. Next, we introduced a novel method (RWRMTN) operating on these mutual heterogeneous miRNA networks to rank candidate disease-related miRNAs using a random walk with restart (RWR) based algorithm. Using both known disease-associated miRNAs and their target genes as seed nodes, the method can identify additional miRNAs involved in the disease phenotype. Experiments indicated that RWRMTN outperformed two existing state-of-the-art methods: RWRMDA, a network-based method that also uses a RWR on homogeneous (rather than heterogeneous) miRNA networks, and RLSMDA, a machine learning-based method. Interestingly, we could relate this performance gain to the emergence of \u201cdisease modules\u201d in the heterogeneous miRNA networks used as input for the algorithm. Moreover, we could demonstrate that RWRMTN is stable, performing well when using both experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-target gene interaction data for network construction. Finally, using RWRMTN, we identified 76 novel miRNAs associated with 23 disease phenotypes which were present in a recent database of known disease-miRNA associations. Conclusions: Summarizing, using random walks on mutual miRNA-target networks improves the prediction of novel disease-associated miRNAs because of the existence of \u201cdisease modules\u201d in these networks.

Specific methods that exploit this principle have been proposed. Local similarity measures only assess direct neighbours of known disease-associated miRNAs [10, 11] or neighbours of candidate miRNAs (as used e.g. by HDMP [17]) in homogeneous miRNA networks. Another state-of-the-art method for disease miRNA prediction, RWRMDA [14, 15], obtains a global network similarity metric by running a random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm (a network propagation technique) on homogeneous miRNA networks. RWR-based techniques were also applied on different network types where either a phenotype similarity network [20] or a protein interaction network [28] was used as input for the analysis. In addition, we recently demonstrated that network-based ranking algorithms, which were successfully applied for either disease gene prediction or for studying social networks and networks of interlinking web pages, could also be used effectively for disease microRNA prediction on homogeneous miRNA networks, achieving comparable performance with the RWR-based method [16]. For heterogeneous networks of diseases and miRNAs, pathfinding-based methods were used [21, 22] that rely on the assumption that the more paths exist between a miRNA and a disease, the more likely it is that there exists an association between them.

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in a variety of biological processes by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. So, the discovery of new miRNAs has become a popular task in biological research. Since the experimental identification of miRNAs is time-consuming, many computational tools have been developed to identify miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). Most of these computation methods are based on traditional machine learning methods and their performance depends heavily on the selected features which are usually determined by domain experts. To develop easily implemented methods with better performance, we investigated different deep learning architectures for the pre-miRNAs identification. Results: In this work, we applied convolution neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict human pre-miRNAs. We combined the sequences with the predicted secondary structures of pre-miRNAs as input features of our models, avoiding the feature extraction and selection process by hand. The models were easily trained on the training dataset with low generalization error, and therefore had satisfactory performance on the test dataset. The prediction results on the same benchmark dataset showed that our models outperformed or were highly comparable to other state-of-the-art methods in this area. Furthermore, our CNN model trained on human dataset had high prediction accuracy on data from other species. Conclusions: Deep neural networks (DNN) could be utilized for the human pre-miRNAs detection with high performance. Complex features of RNA sequences could be automatically extracted by CNN and RNN, which were used for the pre-miRNAs prediction.

Numerous similarity measurement-based approaches according to heterogeneous biological information have been proposed to identify the interactions between microRNAs and diseases. Jiang et al. [16] inferred disease-related miRNAs by prioritizing the whole human miRNAome connected with disease that we investigated based on miRNA functional similarity information as well as the human phenome-microRNAome network. Li et al. [17] proposed a computation-based model to infer the possible disease\u2013related miRNAs via calculations of FCS between the disease-gene and the target-gene, which had verification. There is an assumption that if two various diseases have phenotypic connections, they have similar molecular machinery and similar molecular mechanisms. Xu et al. [18] inferred human disease-connected microRNAs by fusing experimentally verified human disease genes as well as context-dependent miRNA-target interactions to prioritize disease-connected microRNAs. In line with weighted k nearest neighbours, HDMP was proposed by Xuan et al. [19] for identifying potential miRNA-disease associations. They presented a measurement method including the details of the disease term along with phenotypic similarities among diseases for the purpose of measuring the miRNA functional similarities. In addition, considering the miRNAs of the same miRNA family or cluster and their relationship to a group of diseases, they were given a higher weight. However, HDMP is not appropriate for diseases that have sparse connections with miRNAs. Chen et al. [20] developed miRPD in which experimentally verified or predicted interactions between miRNAs and proteins as well as text-extracted connections between protein and disease associations were explicitly utilized to calculate the probability that a microRNA-disease association exists. Chen et al. [21] developed WBSMDA according to the calculation of the within-scores and between-scores of every miRNA-disease group to identify potential disease-related miRNAs. Take a miRNA as an example, there is a miRNA set A whose elements all have known connections with the investigated disease d. The propose of within-scores is finding a miRNA in set A that has the highest similarity score with the investigated miRNA. There is a miRNA set B whose elements all have unknown connections with the investigated disease d. The proposed between-scores involves finding a miRNA in set B that has the highest similarity score with the investigated miRNA. Chen et al. [22] developed HGIMDA through an iteration approach in line with a graph that consists of many different types of bioinformatics information, such as the functional similarities of microRNAs, semantic similarities of diseases, kernel similarity of Gaussian interaction profiles and experimental verification of microRNA-disease connections. Yu et al. [23] proposed an assembled identification approach to infer potential microRNA-disease associations by modifying the existing maximizing information flow methods based on integrated microRNA functional similarity information, disease semantic information and phenotypic similarity information; these potential associations along with manually validated microRNA-disease interactions were placed into a phenome-microRNAome network. Chen et al. [24] presented a novel framework called RKNNMDA that utilizes ranking and k nearest neighbours. They integrated the functional similarity of microRNAs, semantic similarity of diseases, kernel similarity of Gaussian interaction profiles and experimental verification of microRNA-disease association and obtained miRNA\u2019s (disease\u2019s) k nearest neighbours via the KNN model. Next, they implemented the SVM ranking model to re-rank the above k nearest neighbours and thus obtained the eventual rankings of all possible microRNA-disease associations. In addition, RKNNMDA could also predict possible microRNA-disease connections for human diseases that don\u2019t have manually validated associated miRNAs. Chen et al. [25] introduced Jaccard similarity among microRNAs and diseases in the BLHARMDA model to identify potential miRNA-disease interactions and then introduced an improved KNN framework into the bipartite local model method.

This method utilized global network distance measurement, random walk analysis, and the construction of a microRNA-disease network to investigate microRNA-disease connections from a global perspective.

Chen et al. [33] identified miRNA-disease links based on regularized least squares (RLS) for identifying the miRNA-disease links. RLSMDA integrates known disease-microRNA connections, a disease semantic similarities dataset, and a miRNA functional similarities network and is thus suitable for predicting novel miRNAs for diseases without any manually validated connections with microRNAs. Li et al. [34] utilized a matrix completion model in line with manually validated microRNA-disease connections to infer candidates for diseases that did not have any experimentally proven connected microRNAs. In addition, MCMDA does not need negative associations. Chen et al. [35] proposed a random forest-based framework (RFMDA) for microRNA-disease connection prediction. RFMDA identifies possible disease-associated microRNAs by employing the random forest model to identify robust attributes from the miRNA-disease attribute collection. Chen et al.

Here, we addressed this question by integrating shape analysis and feature selection into miRAMINT, a methodology that we used for analyzing multidimensional RNA-seq and proteomic data from a knock-in mouse model (Hdh mice) of Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), a disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in huntingtin (htt). This dataset covers 6 CAG repeat alleles and 3 age points in the striatum and cortex of Hdh mice. Results: Remarkably, compared to previous analyzes of this multidimensional dataset, the miRAMINT approach retained only 31 explanatory striatal miRNA-mRNA pairs that are precisely associated with the shape of CAG repeat dependence over time, among which 5 pairs with a strong change of target expression levels. Several of these pairs were previously associated with neuronal homeostasis or HD pathogenesis, or both. Such miRNA-mRNA pairs were not detected in cortex. Conclusions: These data suggest that miRNA regulation has a limited global role in HD while providing accurately-selected miRNA-target pairs to study how the brain may compute molecular responses to HD over time.

In particular, they can directly interfere with miRNAs functions acting as miRNA sponges [8]. Nevertheless, the number of lncRNAs for which the functional and molecular mechanisms are completely elucidated is still quite poor. This is due to two main reasons: their recent discovery as master regulators with respect to miRNAs, and some particular features, such as the low cross-species conservation, the low expression levels and the high tissue specificity that make their characterization or any type of generalization still very difficult [9].

Background: As regulators of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as critical biomarkers of human diseases.

Different categories of features in miRNAs are applied in these methods for miRNA-miRNA similarity calculation. Benchmarking tests on these miRNA similarity measures are warranted to assess their effectiveness and robustness. Results: In this study, 5 categories of features, i.e. miRNA sequences, miRNA expression profiles in cell-lines, miRNA expression profiles in tissues, gene ontology (GO) annotations of miRNA target genes and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms of miRNA-associated diseases, are collected and similarity values between miRNAs are quantified based on these feature spaces, respectively. We systematically compare the 5 similarities from multi-statistical views. Furthermore, we adopt a rule-based inference method to test their performance on miRNA-disease association predictions with the similarity measurements. Comprehensive comparison is made based on leave-one-out cross-validations and a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that the similarity measurement using MeSH terms performs best among the 5 measurements. It should be noted that the other 4 measurements can also achieve reliable prediction performance. The best-performed similarity measurement is used for new miRNA-disease association predictions and the inferred results are released for further biomedical screening. Conclusions: Our study suggests that all the 5 features, even though some are restricted by data availability, are useful information for inferring novel miRNA-disease associations. However, biased prediction results might be produced in GO- and MeSH-based similarity measurements due to incomplete feature spaces.

However, even after X-chromosome inactivation, a percentage of genes on the X (15% in humans [135] and 3% in mouse [136]) escape inactivation, and are expressed at higher levels in females. Differences in X and Y gene expression appear to exert broad downstream effects, resulting in genome-wide transcriptional differences [100, 110, 137]. One mechanism by which sex chromosomes may exert broad regulatory effects is through epigenetic regulation. A number of important epigenetic modifiers are located on the X-chromosome [138], including lysine demethylases KDM5C and KDM6A (UTX). Both KDM5C and KDM6A are known to escape X-chromosome inactivation, are expressed at higher levels in females, and do not appear to be fully compensated by their Y-chromosome paralogues KDM5D and UTY [139\u2013141]. KDM6A and KDM5C are two of several putative tumor suppressors on the X-chromosome proposed to contribute to decreased cancer risk in females. These genes, along with ATRX, DDX3X, CNKSR2, and MAGEC3 are more frequently mutated in male tumors [142], presumably because females have a second copy to compensate for any loss of function mutations via XCI escape. KDM6A in particular has been found to contribute to sex differences in bladder cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor in XX individuals [143]. It has also been identified as a tumor suppressor in B cell lymphoma [144], T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [145], and pancreatic cancer [146]. In addition to differences in the expression levels of protein-coding genes located on the sex chromosomes, lncRNAs [147] and microRNAs (miRNAs) can also escape X inactivation and differ in expression between the sexes.

The control of tissue level of PGE2 is both through synthesis of PGE2 by the COX enzyme in and its export from pro-inflammatory cells as well as by the removal of PGE2 from the intercellular space by prostaglandin transporter, PGT, and the efficiency of catabolism of PGE2 by enzymes such as 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenease. For instance, expression of the COX-2 enzyme is regulated through many pathways of which several are affected in CRC. As examples of this, somatostatin, SS, has a dampening effect on COX-2 expression, while an autocrine pathway through an epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, an EP4 receptor, and microRNA stimulation increase the expression and/or activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, the activity in PGE2-signalling pathways may vary with the expression of the PGE2 receptor subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, which is affected in CRC. Removal of PGE2 from the extracellular compartment around target cells is by diffusion to the blood stream and uptake and degradation in lung, liver and kidney endothelial cells. Different cellular signalling pathways for PGE2 operation are indicated in the target cell.

Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been associated with various diseases including cancer, thus making them interesting therapeutic targets. The composite of secondary structural elements that comprise miRNAs could aid the design of small molecules that modulate their function. Results: We analyzed the secondary structural elements, or motifs, present in all human miRNA\u00a0hairpin precursors and compared them to highly expressed human RNAs with known structures and other RNAs from various organisms. Amongst human miRNAs, there are 3808 are unique motifs, many residing in processing sites. Further, we identified motifs in miRNAs that are not present in other highly expressed human RNAs, desirable targets for small molecules. MiRNA motifs were incorporated into a searchable database that is freely available. We also analyzed the most frequently occurring bulges and internal loops for each RNA class and found that the smallest loops possible prevail.

Conclusions: Collectively, we have completed a broad survey of motifs found in human miRNA precursors, highly expressed human RNAs, and RNAs from other organisms. Interestingly, unique motifs were identified in human miRNA processing sites, binding to which could inhibit miRNA maturation and hence function.

This is based on their implicit assumption that the most abundant tRF (i.e., \u201cdominant\u201d per their definition) is also the most important one. However, as we already reported in [6], there are many examples of human tRFs that are not the most abundant tRFs in the analyzed samples yet can differentiate among groups of samples by gender, population origin, race, tissue, disease subtype, etc. Moreover, tDRmapper\u2019s assigning of counts from multiple distinct tRFs to a single sequence further complicates matters, because such an aggregation of reads by tDRmapper does not acknowledge the following important fact. As we showed by analyzing hundreds of human tissue samples (see [6]), distinct tRFs that arise from the same anticodon template have uncorrelated abundances even though they can differ only slightly in sequence (the abundances of such distinct fragments are collapsed by tDRmapper into a composite \u2018count\u2019 that will suppress any available signal and skew the endpoints of the molecules that are actually present). This lack of correlation is not specific to tRNAs: indeed, it also holds true for another category of non-coding RNAs the microRNAs (miRNAs), as others [10, 11] and we reported previously [12, 13]. Specifically, in both health and disease, we have shown that different miRNA isoforms from the same miRNA locus can: a) have uncorrelated abundances even though they have very similar sequences [13]; b) differ greatly in their ability to distinguish between gender, population origin, race, tissue, disease subtype, etc. [12, 13]; and, c) have very distinct regulatory roles and downstream targets [13]. The numerous dependencies that tRF sequences have been shown to have on the cell/tissue type of origin, the disease type/sub-type, and the attributes of the person from whom the RNA is sourced, are evidence that does not support the hypothesis of \u201cdominant\u201d tRFs.", "article_type": "letter", "sec_type": "other", "pmid": "26961774", "type": "P", "id": 8, "pmcid": "PMC4785646"}

Background: Several techniques have been tailored to the quantification of microRNA expression, including hybridization arrays, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and high-throughput sequencing. Each of these has certain strengths and limitations depending both on the technology itself and the algorithm used to convert raw data into expression estimates. Reliable quantification of microRNA expression is challenging in part due to the relatively low abundance and short length of the miRNAs. While substantial research has been devoted to the development of methods to quantify mRNA expression, relatively little effort has been spent on microRNA expression. Results: In this work, we focus on the Life Technologies TaqMan OpenArray\u24c7 system, a qPCR-based platform to measure microRNA expression. Several algorithms currently exist to estimate expression from the raw amplification data produced by qPCR-based technologies. To assess and compare the performance of these methods, we performed a set of dilution/mixture experiments to create a benchmark data set. We also developed a suite of statistical assessments that evaluate many different aspects of performance: accuracy, precision, titration response, number of complete features, limit of detection, and data quality. The benchmark data and software are freely available via two R/Bioconductor packages, miRcomp and miRcompData. Finally, we demonstrate use of our software by comparing two widely used algorithms and providing assessments for four other algorithms. Conclusions: Benchmark data sets and software are crucial tools for the assessment and comparison of competing algorithms.

In recent years, a number of studies have reported that the dysfunctions on microRNA (miRNAs), environmental factors or their interactions have strong effects on phenotypes and even may result in abnormal phenotypes and diseases [1]. Environmental chemicals have been shown to play a critical role in the etiology of many human diseases [2]. Studies have also demonstrated the link between specific miRNAs and aspects of pathogenesis [3]. The fact that a miRNA may regulate hundreds of targets and one gene might be regulated by more than one miRNAs makes the underlying mechanism of miRNA pathogenicity more complex. Many miRNA targets have been computationally predicted, but only a limited number of these were experimentally validated. Although a variety of miRNA target prediction methods are available, resulting lists of candidate target genes identified by these methods often do not overlap and thus show inconsistency. Hence, finding a functional miRNA target is still a challenging task [4]. Some integration methods and tools for comprehensive analysis of miRNA target prediction have been developed, such as miRGen [5], miRWalk [6], starBase [7], and ComiR [8]. However, it is rarely seen the consolidation and comparison of miRNA target prediction methods with chemicals, diseases, pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) related applications. Thus, it is crucial to develop the bioinformatics tools for more accurate prediction as it is equally important to validate the predicted target genes experimentally [9]. In this study, we develop a ChemiRs web server, in which various miRNA prediction methods and biological databases are integrated and relations between miRNAs, chemicals, genes, diseases and pathways are analyzed. First, we manually retrieved the associations of miRNAs and chemicals from biomedical literature, and downloaded toxicogenomics data from the comparative toxicogenomic database (CTD; http://ctd.mdibl.org) [10]. Then, our method integrated the latest versions of publicly available miRNA target prediction methods and curated databases, including DIANA-microT [11, 12], miRanda [13], miRDB [14], RNAhybrid [15], PicTar [16], PITA [17], RNA22 [18], TargetScan [19], miRWalk [6], miRecords [20], miR2Disease [21], and miRBase [22, 23]. A set of experimentally validated target genes integrated from the miRecords and mirTarBase [24] servers is also integrated in the ChemiRs server. In addition, information from KEGG [25], REACTOME [26], and Gene Ontology [27] databases were organized into ChemiRs manually. The logical restriction was also designed to compare different miRNA target prediction methods easily using R (http://www.r-project.org) for statistics.", "article_type": "research-article", "sec_type": "background", "pmid": "27091357", "type": "P", "id": 2, "pmcid": "PMC4836156"}

Background: Global run-on coupled with deep sequencing (GRO-seq) provides extensive information on the location and function of coding and non-coding transcripts, including primary microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), as well as yet undiscovered classes of transcripts. However, few computational tools tailored toward this new type of sequencing data are available, limiting the applicability of GRO-seq data for identifying novel transcription units. Results: Here, we present groHMM, a computational tool in R, which defines the boundaries of transcription units de novo using a two state hidden-Markov model (HMM). A systematic comparison of the performance between groHMM and two existing peak-calling methods tuned to identify broad regions (SICER and HOMER) favorably supports our approach on existing GRO-seq data from MCF-7 breast cancer cells. To demonstrate the broader utility of our approach, we have used groHMM to annotate a diverse array of transcription units (i.e., primary transcripts) from four GRO-seq data sets derived from cells representing a variety of different human tissue types, including non-transformed cells (cardiomyocytes and lung fibroblasts) and transformed cells (LNCaP and MCF-7 cancer cells), as well as non-mammalian cells (from flies and worms). As an example of the utility of groHMM and its application to questions about the transcriptome, we show how groHMM can be used to analyze cell type-specific enhancers as defined by newly annotated enhancer transcripts. Conclusions: Our results show that groHMM can reveal new insights into cell\u00a0type-specific transcription by identifying novel transcription units, and serve as a complete and useful tool for evaluating functional genomic elements in cells.
