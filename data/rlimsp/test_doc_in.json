The activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) is restricted by their substrate specificities. The analysis of PTP specificity was greatly helped by the discovery that \"substrate-trapping\" PTP mutants, such as PTP-1B D181A, stably and specifically bind their substrates. We have set up a PTP substrate specificity assay based on the SPOT technique, which involves the microsynthesis of (phospho)peptides on membranes. To validate this approach, substrate trapping PTP-1B was tested on its cognate ligand, the autophosphorylated insulin receptor (IR). On SPOT membranes, IR peptides with phosphotyrosine 1163 were efficiently bound by PTP1B D181A, and dephosphorylated by PTP-1B. Phosphotyrosine 1163 was preferred over the neighboring 1158 and 1162 phosphotyrosines. PTP-1B also recognized IR-like motifs in Trk autophosphorylation domains, and STAT 5 phosphopeptides. Using a gridded 20-by-20 SPOT library, we show that peptides with the YZM motif (Z: phosphotyrosine) are the strongest ligands for PTP-1B D181A, but not the optimal substrates for dephosphorylation by wild-type PTP1B. In addition we show that PTP-1B and PTP-beta dephosphorylation efficiency is strongly modulated by the introduction of phospho-serine or phospho-threonine in their cognate phospho-tyrosine substrates.

Liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is key for the characterization of phosphorylation sites in a high-throughput manner, and its application has proven essential to elucidate the phosphoproteome of many biological systems. Following proteolytic digestion of proteins extracted from tissues or cells, phosphopeptides are typically enriched by affinity chromatography using TiO2 or metal-ions (e.g., Fe3+) coupled to solid-phase materials, prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Separation of relatively low abundance phosphopeptides from nonphosphorylated peptides in these types of extremely complex mixtures is essential to maximize coverage of the phosphoproteome. Maintaining acidic conditions during these IMAC or TiO2-based enrichment minimizes the concurrent unwanted binding of highly acidic peptides. However, while peptides containing phosphomonoesters, namely, phosphoserine (pSer), phosphothreonine (pThr), and phosphotyrosine (pTyr), are stable under these acidic binding conditions, phosphopeptides containing acid-labile phosphate group such as phosphohistidine (pHis), are not. Consequently, hydrolysis of these types of phosphopeptides occurs during standard phosphopeptide enrichment, and subsequent phosphosite identification by LC-MS/MS is severely compromised.

In basal cells, there was one major insulin receptor-derived tryptic phosphothreonine peptide and at least four phosphoserine peptides. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) stimulated phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, some of the basal phosphoserine peptides, and at least one phosphoserine peptide that was not detected in the basal state. Staurosporine completely inhibited the PDBU-mediated phosphorylation. Although staurosporine also inhibited basal phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, down-regulation of PKC did not, suggesting that PKC does not mediate basal insulin receptor phosphorylation. Insulin treatment resulted in the appearance of four phosphotyrosine peptides. It also stimulated the phosphorylation of at least two phosphoserine peptides. One of these may have been a complex of two or more distinct but poorly resolved phosphopeptides, which was seen in basal cells and a component of which seemed to be stimulated by PDBU. However, neither staurosporine nor down-regulation of PKC diminished insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of these peptides, indicating that insulin-stimulated receptor serine phosphorylation did not involve PKC activity.

The nanoelectrospray product ion spectra of multiply charged phosphopeptide anions reveal the occurrence of phosphate-specific high-mass fragment ions of the type [M - nH - 79](n-1)-. These so far unrecognized fragments, which are observed for phosphoserine-, phosphothreonine-, and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, are the counterparts of the established inorganic phosphopeptide marker ion found at m/z 79 = [PO3]-. The high-mass marker ions are formed with high efficiency at moderate collision offset values and are particularly useful for sensitive recognition of pSer-, pThr-, and pTyr-peptides due to the low background level in MS/MS spectra at m/z values above those of the precursor ions. By virtue of this feature, the detection of the new phosphorylation-specific fragment ions appears to be more sensitive than the detection of the low-mass phosphate marker ion at m/z 79, where a higher interference by nonspecific background signals is generally observed. The number of phosphate groups within a phosphopeptide can also be estimated on the basis of the [M - nH - 79](n-1)- ions, since these exhibit an effective, sequential neutral loss of H3PO4 of the residing phosphate groups. A mechanistic explanation for the formation of the [M - nH - 79](n-1)- ions from multiply charged phosphopeptides is given.

Using classical genetics to study modular phosphopeptide-binding domains within a family of proteins that are functionally redundant is difficult when other members of the domain family compensate for the product of the knocked-out gene. Here we describe a chemical genetics approach that overcomes this limitation by using UV-activatable caged phosphopeptides. By incorporating a caged phosphoserine residue within a consensus motif, these reagents simultaneously and synchronously inactivate all phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding domain family members in a rapid and temporally regulated manner.

PPM1D is amplified or Wip1 is overexpressed in several human cancers, and it acts as a weak oncogene. Although inhibition of Wip1 may have therapeutic value, no specific inhibitors are available. In this study, we designed phosphopeptide inhibitors for Wip1 on the basis of its optimal substrate sequence. We found that phosphoserine-containing diphosphorylated peptides with the sequence pSXpY inhibited Wip1 phosphatase activity, whereas phosphothreonine-containing peptides with the sequence pTXpY were physiological substrates. Moreover, the X residue in the pSXpY sequence modulated inhibitor activity, and beta-branched amino acid-substituted (Ile or Val) phosphopeptides showed high inhibitory potencies. A thioether cyclic phosphopeptide c(MpSIpYVA) had a K(i) <1.0 microM.

For large peptides (> or =18 amino acids), the elution time shifts due to single phosphorylation were limited (ranging between -0.48 and +0.03 min), while the elution time shifts for small peptides (<18 amino acids) were characterized by a larger deviation (ranging between -5.28 and +0.59 min).

The abnormally phosphorylated forms of tau factor are major constituents of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. In order to investigate protein phosphatases which are related to dephosphorylation of abnormal phosphorylation sites, we examined the dephosphorylation of tau factor phosphorylated by three proline-directed type protein kinases. Tau factor phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase and tau protein kinase II was dephosphorylated by the holoenzyme of protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin, while either the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A or protein phosphatase 2C could not catalyze the dephosphorylation. From the kinetic analysis, we concluded that tau factors phosphorylated by the protein kinases serve as good substrates for protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin. On the other hand, tau factor phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha was dephosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatases 2A as well as the holoenzyme of protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin. It has been reported that serines 199, 202 and 396 according to the numbering of the longest human tau isoform are among the major abnormal phosphorylation sites of tau factor. We synthesized two phosphopeptides which contained phosphoserines 199 and 202 or phosphoserine 396 and prepared the polyclonal antibodies specific for the phosphopeptides.

Neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain were immunostained with both antibodies but the normal neurons in the normal aged brains were not.

Exhaustive digestion of (32)P-labeled large T antigen with trypsin generated six major phosphopeptides which could be separated in a newly developed isobutyric acid-containing chromatography system. By partial tryptic digestion, large T antigen was cleaved into an amino-terminal fragment of 17,000 daltons and overlapping fragments from the carboxy-terminal region ranging in size between 71,000 and 13,000 daltons.

METHODS: Phosphopeptide immunoprecipitation of six technical replicates corresponding to 10mg protein from HCT116 cells was performed using agarose bead-coupled phosphotyrosine antibodies P-Tyr-1000 (N=3) and 4G10 (N=3). NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. For relative quantitation of protein phosphorylation, spectral counts of phosphoproteins and ion intensities of phosphopeptides were determined using MaxQuant. RESULTS: From the 3 samples incubated with P-Tyr-1000 a total of 689 phosphopeptides were identified with 60% ID reproducibility. The phosphopeptide capture using 4G10 resulted in a total of 421 at 46% ID reproducibility. The P-Tyr-1000 was applied to EGFR mutated U87 cells. Erlotinib reduced EGFR phosphorylation with 59% at y978, y1125, y1138, y1172, and y1197. EGFR inhibition was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of FYN, MET, PTK2, DYRK1A, MAPK1 and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: The P-Tyr-1000 phosphotyrosine antibody performs superiorly when compared to 4G10 antibody for label-free phosphotyrosine-based phosphoproteomics. This workflow allows evaluation of drug target phosphorylation and may give insights in the pharmacodynamic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the past decade multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been implemented in standard treatment regimens for patients with cancer. Unfortunately the majority of patients develops resistance to these drugs. Reliable tools for analysis of pharmacodynamic effects and drug resistance mechanisms are therefore warranted. Phosphoproteomic analyses have meanwhile emerged as a sophisticated approach for the determination of protein phosphorylation. These analyses rely on antibodies for enrichment of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. Here we compared two commercially available phosphotyrosine antibodies and show that P-Tyr-1000 yields 64% more phosphopeptides than 4G10 antibody, while including almost all 4G10 captured phosphopeptides. The workflow can be reproducibly performed at intermediate protein input levels of 10mg. Furthermore, application of the P-Tyr-1000 antibody in a standardized phosphoproteomics workflow allows relative quantitation of drug target inhibition and provides insights in alternative signaling pathways in cancer cells.

Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was studied in intact well differentiated hepatoma cells (Fao) and in a solubilized and partially purified receptor preparation obtained from these cells by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin agarose. Tryptic peptides containing the phosphorylation sites of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphoamino acid content of these peptides was determined by acid hydrolysis and high voltage electrophoresis. Separation of the phosphopeptides from unstimulated Fao cells revealed one major and two minor phosphoserine-containing peptides and a single minor phosphothreonine-containing peptide. Insulin (10(-7) M) increased the phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor 3- to 4-fold in the intact Fao cell. After insulin stimulation, two phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were identified. Tyrosine phosphorylation reached a steady state within 20 s after the addition of insulin and remained nearly constant for 1 h. Under our experimental conditions, no significant change in the amount of [32P]phosphoserine or [32P]phosphothreonine associated with the beta-subunit was found during the initial response of cells to insulin. When the insulin receptor was extracted from the Fao cells and incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+, very little phosphorylation occurred in the absence of insulin. In this preparation, insulin rapidly stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues only and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the beta-subunit digested with trypsin revealed one minor and two major phosphopeptides. The elution position of the minor peptide corresponded to that of the major phosphotyrosine-containing peptide obtained from the beta-subunit of the insulin-stimulated receptor labeled in vivo. In contrast, the elution position of one of the major phosphopeptides that occurred during in vitro phosphorylation corresponded to the minor phosphotyrosine-containing peptide phosphorylated in vivo. The other major in vitro phosphotyrosine-containing peptide was not detected in vivo. Our results indicate that: tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor occurs rapidly following insulin binding to intact cells; the level of tyrosine phosphorylation remains constant for up to 1 h; the specificity of the receptor kinase or accessibility of the phosphorylation sites are different in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 88, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 343, "charStart": 90}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 512, "charStart": 345}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 624, "charStart": 514}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 809, "charStart": 626}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 939, "charStart": 811}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1023, "charStart": 941}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1361, "charStart": 1025}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1537, "charStart": 1363}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1791, "charStart": 1539}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1985, "charStart": 1793}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2186, "charStart": 1987}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2272, "charStart": 2188}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2597, "charStart": 2274}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2630, "charStart": 2598}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Kinetics", "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Rats", "Receptor, Insulin", "Trypsin", "Vanadates", "Vanadium"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Gel filtration of the digest through Sephadex G-25 (fine) yielded three fractions, the first containing primarily peptides 1-44 and 45-87, the second peptides 15-44, 88-109, and 110-151, and the third peptides 1-14 and 152-168.

Second, fragmentation spectra of phosphopeptides, in particular those of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing peptides, are often dominated by the loss of the phosphate group(s) and therefore lack the information required to identify the peptide sequence and the site of phosphorylation, and third, sequence database search engines and statistical models for data validation are not optimized for the specific fragmentation properties of phosphorylated peptides.

In vitro studies have shown that OPN can inhibit the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) and other biologically relevant crystal phases, and that this inhibitory activity requires phosphorylation of the protein; however, it is not known which phosphorylated residues are involved. We have synthesized peptides corresponding to four phosphoserine-containing sequences in rat OPN: OPN7-17, containing phosphoserines 10 and 11; OPN41-52, containing phosphoserines 46 and 47; OPN248-264, containing phosphoserines 250, 257 and 262; and OPN290-301, containing phosphoserines 295-297. The abilities of these peptides to inhibit de novo HA formation were determined using a constant-composition autotitration assay. All four OPN phosphopeptides caused a dose-dependent increase in nucleation lag time, but did not significantly affect subsequent formation of the crystals.

Five model phosphopeptides, including three synthetic P-Ser-, P-Thr-, or P-Ser- and P-Thr-containing peptides; a protein kinases C-phosphorylated peptide; and a phosphopeptide derived from beta-casein trypsin digests were modified and then sequenced using an ESI-quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer.

Several methods have been developed to deal with the low sensitivity and specificity of phosphopeptide analysis.

The substitution of the negatively charged phosphate group by a positively charged S-ethylpyridyl group greatly improves the ionisation of the modified peptides, especially in MALDI MS, increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. The modification allows the formation of a unique fragment ion at m/z 106 under mild collisional activation conditions, which can be used for parent (precursor) ion scanning in order to improve both the sensitivity and the selectivity of the analysis.

We developed and compared two approaches for automated validation of phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra identified using database searching algorithms. Phosphopeptide identifications were obtained through SEQUEST searches of a protein database appended with its decoy (reversed sequences). Statistical evaluation and iterative searches were employed to create a high-quality data set of phosphopeptides. Automation of postsearch validation was approached by two different strategies. By using statistical multiple testing, we calculate a p value for each tentative peptide phosphorylation. In a second method, we use a support vector machine (SVM; a machine learning algorithm) binary classifier to predict whether a tentative peptide phosphorylation is true. We show good agreement (85%) between postsearch validation of phosphopeptide/spectrum matches by multiple testing and that from support vector machines. Automatic methods conform very well with manual expert validation in a blinded test. Additionally, the algorithms were tested on the identification of synthetic phosphopeptides. We show that phosphate neutral losses in tandem mass spectra can be used to assess the correctness of phosphopeptide/spectrum matches. An SVM classifier with a radial basis function provided classification accuracy from 95.7% to 96.8% of the positive data set, depending on search algorithm used. Establishing the efficacy of an identification is a necessary step for further postsearch interrogation of the spectra for complete localization of phosphorylation sites. Our current implementation performs validation of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing peptides having one or two phosphorylation sites from data gathered on an ion trap mass spectrometer.

The Xenopus cdk2 gene encodes a 32-kDa protein kinase with sequence similarity to the 34-kDa product of the cdc2 gene. Previous studies have shown that the kinase activity of the protein product of the cdk2 gene oscillates in the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle with a high in M-phase and a low in interphase. In the present study cdk2 was found not to be associated with any newly synthesized proteins during the cell cycle, but the enzyme did undergo periodic changes in phosphorylation. Upon exit from metaphase, cdk2 became increasingly phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine residues, and labeling on these residues increased progressively until entry into mitosis, when tyrosine residues were markedly dephosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping of cdk2 demonstrated the major sites of phosphorylation were in a phosphopeptide with a pI of 3.7 that contained both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. This phosphopeptide accumulated in egg extracts blocked in S-phase with aphidicolin and was not evident in cdc2 immunoprecipitated under the same conditions. Under the same conditions cdc2 was phosphorylated primarily on a phosphopeptide containing both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues, most likely threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Affinity-purified human GST-cdc25 was able to dephosphorylate and activate cdk2 isolated from interphase cells. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the phosphate was specifically removed from the same phosphopeptide identified as the major in vivo site of phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that cdk2 is regulated in the cell cycle by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on both serine and tyrosine residues. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation of cdk2 in aphidicolin-blocked extracts and the ability of cdc25 to mediate cdk2 dephosphorylation in vitro suggest the possibility that cdk2 is part of the mechanism ensuring mitosis is not initiated until completion of DNA replication.

Without insulin, the receptor contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine and could be immunoprecipitated with anti-receptor antibody but not with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After incubation of these cells with insulin, both antibodies immunoprecipitated the phosphorylated receptor.

Sequential immunoprecipitation of receptor with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by precipitation of the remaining proteins with anti-receptor antibody suggests that insulin receptors which contain phosphoserine in the basal state are tyrosine phosphorylated more slowly than the dephosphorylated receptors or not at all after the addition of insulin. The beta-subunit of the insulin receptor was the major phosphorylated protein precipitated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from insulin-stimulated Fao cells.

We present an optimized analytical strategy for plasma membrane phosphoproteomics that combines efficient plasma membrane protein preparation with TiO(2)-based phosphopeptide enrichment and high-performance mass spectrometry for phosphopeptide sequencing. We used sucrose centrifugation in combination with sodium carbonate extraction to achieve efficient and reproducible purification of low microgram levels of plasma membrane proteins from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs, 10(7) cells), achieving more than 70% yield of membrane proteins. Phosphopeptide enrichment by titanium dioxide chromatography followed by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allowed us to assign 703 unique phosphorylation sites in 376 phosphoproteins. Our experiments revealed that treatment of cell cultures with three different types of protein phosphatase inhibitors produces distinct phosphopeptide populations and an increase of 10-40% of the number of detected and sequenced phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine containing peptides.

Chemical labeling by beta-elimination/Michael addition is also useful for increasing mass intensity in phosphopeptide analysis. Both of these methods were coupled in order to simultaneously enrich phosphopeptides and allow for detection and sequencing of the enriched peptides with high mass sensitivity. Phosphopeptides were successfully enriched on TiO2 beads without the use of any hydroxy acid additives like 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Labeling was accomplished on-bead with a guanidinoethanethiol (GET) tag containing a guanidine moiety. These GET-labeled derivatives were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). GET labeling converted phosphoserine into guanidinoethylcysteine, a structural arginine-mimic. In particular, GET-labeled lysine-terminated phosphopeptides showed dramatically increased peak intensities compared to those of the corresponding intact phosphopeptides. Additionally, the on-bead labeling minimized manipulation steps and sample loss. The coupled technique was also further validated by applying to the analysis of phosphopeptides from complex tryptic digests of phosphoprotein mixtures.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 183, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 354, "charStart": 185}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 482, "charStart": 356}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 659, "charStart": 484}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 794, "charStart": 661}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 897, "charStart": 796}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1037, "charStart": 899}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1132, "charStart": 1039}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1303, "charStart": 1134}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1384, "charStart": 1305}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1537, "charStart": 1386}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Caseins", "Guanidine", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Ovalbumin", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Sulfhydryl Compounds", "Titanium"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Validation Study"]}

The cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor (HIR) from the baculovirus expression system (BIRK) is a soluble, constitutively activated protein-tyrosine kinase. In a cell-free system, BIRK is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues by protein kinase C (PKC) purified from rat brain. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of PKC-phosphorylated BIRK identified one phosphothreonine and three phosphoserine peptides, which were also in tryptic digests of insulin receptors from insulin- or PMA-treated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the HIR. After Lys-C proteolysis of PKC-phosphorylated BIRK, radioactive phosphopeptides were purified on a C8 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column. Amino acid sequence analysis identified a phosphothreonine peptide corresponding to amino acids 1331-1340 of the HIR. This peptide contains only one threonine, amino acid 1336, which is identified as a site for PKC phosphorylation in BIRK. CHO cells transfected with the wild type (CHO/HIR) or a mutant human insulin receptor (CHO/HIRT1336N), in which threonine 1336 was substituted with asparagine, were 32P labeled and then stimulated with insulin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis of the HIR revealed that phosphorylation of phosphothreonine peptide T, shown to be in PKC-phosphorylated BIRK, was increased by insulin or PMA. However, the corresponding peptide was not in the mutant receptor. Therefore, the present study directly identifies threonine 1336 in the HIR as a phosphorylation site for insulin and PMA.

SH2 (src-homology 2) domains define a newly recognized binding motif that mediates the physical association of target phosphotyrosyl proteins with downstream effector enzymes. An example of such phosphoprotein-effector coupling is provided by the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) with specific phosphorylation sites within the PDGF receptor, the c-Src/polyoma virus middle T antigen complex and the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1. Notably, phosphoprotein association with the SH2 domains of p85 also stimulates an increase in catalytic activity of the PI 3-kinase p110 subunit, which can be mimicked by phosphopeptides corresponding to targeted phosphoprotein phosphorylation sites. To investigate how phosphoprotein binding to the p85 SH2 domain stimulates p110 catalytic activation, we have examined the differential effects of phosphotyrosine and PDGF receptor-, IRS-1- and c-Src-derived phosphopeptides on the conformation of an isolated SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase. Although phosphotyrosine and both activating and non-activating phosphopeptides bind to the SH2 domain, activating phosphopeptides bind with higher affinity and induce a qualitatively distinct conformational change as monitored by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Amide proton exchange and protease protection assays further show that high affinity, specific phosphopeptide binding induces non-local dynamic SH2 domain stabilization.

However, the presence of anti-RC monoclonal antibody (200 ng/ml) in the enzyme reaction mixture caused a remarkable elevation of phosphatase activity toward three phosphoaminoacids in the hepatic cytosol at 24 and 48 h after hepatectomy. In the liver nuclei after sham operation or hepatectomy, phosphatase activity toward three phosphoaminoacids was significantly raised by the addition of anti-RC antibody (150 ng/ml). The nuclear phosphatase activity toward phosphothreonine in regenerating liver was significantly enhanced in the presence of anti-RC antibody (100 and 150 ng/ml). The effect of anti-RC antibody to increase phosphatase activity toward three phosphoaminoacids in the cytosol and nuclei of regenerating liver was completely blocked by the addition of exogenous RC (1.0 microM).

We test ions at these m/z values for the presence of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues using tandem mass spectrometry (MS(2)) in a vacuum MALDI ion trap mass spectrometer, where the neutral loss of the elements of H(3)PO(4) (98 Da) provides a sensitive assay for the presence of phosphopeptides. Subsequent MS(3) analysis of the (M + H - 98)(+) peaks allows us to confirm or reject the hypotheses that the putative phosphopeptides are present in the sample. HMS-MS was successfully applied to the detection and identification of phosphopeptides from substrates of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdc28, phosphorylated in vitro (Ipl1) and in vivo (Orc6), basing hypothesis formation on the minimal Cdk consensus phosphorylation motif Ser/Thr-Pro.

In order to investigate gas-phase fragmentation reactions of phosphorylated peptide ions, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were recorded from synthetic phosphopeptides and from phosphopeptides isolated from natural sources.

ESI-MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphopeptides containing two arginine residues support the following general fragmentation rule: Increased amide bond cleavage on the C-terminal side of phosphorylated serines or threonines mainly occurs in peptide ions which do not contain mobile protons. In MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra of phosphopeptides displaying N-terminal fragment ions, abundant b-H(3)PO(4) ions resulting from the enhanced dissociation of the pSer/pThr-X bond were detected (X denotes amino acids). Cleavages at phosphoamino acids were found to be particularly predominant in spectra of phosphopeptides containing pSer/pThr-Pro bonds.

Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are found in a variety of signaling proteins and bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences. To explore the binding properties of the SH2 domain of the Src protein kinase, we used immobilized phosphopeptides to bind purified glutathione S-transferase-Src SH2 fusion proteins. With this assay, as well as a free-peptide competition assay, we have estimated the affinities of the Src SH2 domain for various phosphopeptides relative to a Src SH2-phosphopeptide interaction whose Kd has been determined previously (YEEI-P; Kd = 4 nM). Two Src-derived phosphopeptides, one containing the regulatory C-terminal Tyr-527 and another containing the autophosphorylation site Tyr-416, bind the Src SH2 domain in a specific though low-affinity manner (with about 10(4)-lower affinity than the YEEI-P peptide). A platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) phosphopeptide containing Tyr-857 does not bind appreciably to the Src SH2 domain, suggesting it is not the PDGF-R binding site for Src as previously reported. However, another PDGF-R-derived phosphopeptide containing Tyr-751 does bind the Src SH2 domain (with an affinity approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of YEEI-P). All of the phosphopeptides which bind to the Src SH2 domain contain a glutamic acid at position -3 or -4 with respect to phosphotyrosine; changing this residue to alanine greatly diminishes binding. We have also tested Src SH2 mutants for their binding properties and have interpreted our results in light of the recent crystal structure solution for the Src SH2 domain. Mutations in various conserved and nonconserved residues (R155A, R155K, N198E, H201R, and H201L) cause slight reductions in binding, while two mutations cause severe reductions. The W148E mutant domain, which alters the invariant tryptophan that marks the N-terminal border of the SH2 domain, binds poorly to phosphopeptides. Inclusion of the SH3 domain in the fusion protein partially restores the binding by the W148E mutant. A change in the invariant arginine that coordinates twice with phosphotyrosine in the peptide (R175L) results in a nearly complete loss of binding. The R175L mutant does display high affinity for the PDGF-R peptide containing Tyr-751, via an interaction that is at least partly phosphotyrosine independent. We have used this interaction to show that the R175L mutation also disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the Src SH2 domain and the phosphorylated C terminus within the context of the entire Src protein; thus, the binding properties observed for mutant domains in an in vitro assay appear to mimic those that occur in vivo.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 121, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 250, "charStart": 123}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 433, "charStart": 252}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 688, "charStart": 435}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 955, "charStart": 690}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1166, "charStart": 957}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1343, "charStart": 1168}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1542, "charStart": 1345}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1714, "charStart": 1544}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1892, "charStart": 1716}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2040, "charStart": 1894}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2142, "charStart": 2042}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2290, "charStart": 2144}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2449, "charStart": 2292}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2783, "charStart": 2451}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Binding, Competitive", "Conserved Sequence", "In Vitro Techniques", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Recent studies suggest that acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), an enzyme with crucial roles in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and lipogenesis and essential for cancer cell survival, may be a novel binding partner for BRCA1, through interactions with its BRCT domains. We report here the crystal structure at 3.2 A resolution of human BRCA1 BRCT domains in complex with a phospho-peptide from human ACC1 (p-ACC1 peptide, with the sequence 1258-DSPPQ-pS-PTFPEAGH-1271), which provides molecular evidence for direct interactions between BRCA1 and ACC1. The p-ACC1 peptide is bound in an extended conformation, located in a groove between the tandem BRCT domains. There are recognizable and significant structural differences to the binding modes of two other phospho-peptides to these domains, from BACH1 and CtIP, even though they share a conserved pSer-Pro-(Thr/Val)-Phe motif.

Alkaline-induced beta-elimination of phosphate from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues followed by addition of an affinity tag has recently been pursued as a strategy for enriching phosphorylated species from complex mixtures. Here we report the use of an introduced thiol tag as the ligand for affinity purification via disulfide exchange with an activated thiol resin and the development of a protocol to improve the sensitivity considerably over previous reports (i.e., to subpicomole levels.) During our experiments, we observed a side reaction in which water was eliminated from unmodified serine residues. This side reaction resulted in the introduction of the affinity tag into unphosphorylated proteins, confounding attempts to specifically purify phosphoproteins from mixtures. Unchecked, this side reaction will also prevent application of the beta-elimination strategy to phosphopeptide samples where the phosphorylated species are minor components (i.e., most current phosphoproteomics applications). Quantitation of the side reaction products using three synthetic unphosphorylated peptides showed varying conversion efficiencies; at maximum, 1.7% of unphosphorylated peptide was converted to the affinity-tagged form. Inclusion of EDTA into the reaction reduced the side reaction but also greatly reduced the conversion efficiency of one of the phosphoserine residues of ovalbumin, suggesting a role for trace metal ions in the beta-elimination chemistry. Despite the presence of the side reaction, the affinity strategy was shown to be effective at enriching phosphopeptides from fairly complex peptide mixtures.

Abundant neutral losses of 98 Da are often observed upon ion trap CID-MS/MS of protonated phosphopeptide ions. Two competing fragmentation pathways are involved in this process, namely, the direct loss of H3PO4 from the phosphorylated residue and the combined losses of HPO3 and H2O from the phosphorylation site and from an additional site within the peptide, respectively. These competing pathways produce product ions with different structures but the same m/z values, potentially limiting the utility of CID-MS(3) for phosphorylation site localization. To quantify the relative contributions of these pathways and to determine the conditions under which each pathway predominates, we have examined the ion trap CID-MS/MS fragmentation of a series of regioselective (18)O-phosphate ester labeled phosphopeptides prepared using novel solution-phase amino acid synthesis and solid-phase peptide synthesis methodologies. By comparing the intensity of the -100 Da (-H3PO3 (18)O) versus -98 Da (-[HPO3 + H2O]) neutral loss product ions formed upon MS/MS, quantification of the two pathways was achieved. Factors that affect the extent of formation of the competing neutral losses were investigated, with the combined loss pathway predominantly occurring under conditions of limited proton mobility, and with increased combined losses observed for phosphothreonine compared with phosphoserine-containing peptides. The combined loss pathway was found to be less dominant under ion activation conditions associated with HCD-MS/MS.

A cell-permeable diacylglycerol that mimics phorbol diester action on the epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogenesis. The cell-permeable diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), is shown to mimic the effect of tumor promoting phorbol diesters on epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding and action in intact cells. DiC8 inhibited the binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate to A431 cell monolayers indicating that the diacylglycerol interacts with the phorbol diester receptor. At 0.3 microM, DiC8 half-maximally inhibited the high affinity binding of 125I-EGF to A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Scatchard analysis indicated that the inhibition of 125I-EGF binding was very similar to that observed in the presence of 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA). DiC8 also mimicked the action of PMA to increase the phosphorylation state of the EGF receptor in 32P-labeled cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that DiC8 and PMA caused an increase in the level of EGF-receptor phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, whereas EGF caused an increase in the level of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Phosphopeptide mapping of the EGF receptor showed that DiC8 and PMA enhanced the phosphorylation of the same tryptic peptides. DiC8 inhibited the EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in A431 cells in a similar manner to that observed with PMA. In further experiments with quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, DiC8 mimicked the ability of PMA to stimulate the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine synergistically with low concentrations of EGF. This result indicates that DiC8 will mimic the long-term effects of PMA to regulate mitogenesis and raises the possibility that it may be active in two stage carcinogenesis.

The clinical outcome of Helicobacter pylori infections is determined by multiple host-pathogen interactions that may develop to chronic gastritis, and sometimes peptic ulcers or gastric cancer. Highly virulent strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that delivers the effector protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA-sequence motifs, called A, B and C in Western-type strains, by members of the oncogenic Src and Abl host kinases. Phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs mediate interactions of CagA with host signaling factors--in particular various SH2-domain containing human proteins--thereby hijacking multiple downstream signaling cascades. Observations of tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA are mainly based on the use of commercial phosphotyrosine antibodies, which originally were selected to detect phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. Systematic studies of phosphorylated EPIYA-motif detection by the different antibodies would be very useful, but are not yet available. To address this issue, we synthesized phospho- and non-phosphopeptides representing each predominant Western CagA EPIYA-motif, and determined the recognition patterns of seven different phosphotyrosine antibodies in Western blots, and also performed infection studies with diverse representative Western H. pylori strains. Our results show that a total of 9-11 amino acids containing the phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs are necessary and sufficient for specific detection by these antibodies, but revealed great variability in sequence recognition. Three of the antibodies recognized phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs A, B and C similarly well; whereas preferential binding to phosphorylated motif A and motifs A and C was found with two and one antibodies, respectively, and the seventh anti-phosphotyrosine antibody did not recognize any phosphorylated EPIYA-motif. Controls showed that none of the antibodies recognized the corresponding non-phospho CagA peptides, and that all of them recognized phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins.

As with virus mutated at the first cysteine residue, mutation of the second cysteine (C97) within the motif resulted in a marked reduction in viral growth and attenuation of cytopathogenicity in infected cell cultures. However, mutagenesis of this second cysteine only reduced phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity to 70 % of that of wild-type VP2, but increased phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase activity by as much as 700 %.

The structural elements, specificity and binding kinetics of the dShc PTB domain have now been characterized.

Competition binding assays using truncated versions of the Der peptides revealed that high affinity binding to the dShc PTB domain requires, in addition to the NPXpY motif, the presence of hydrophobic residues at both positions -5 and -7 relative to phosphotyrosine. The dShc PTB domain showed a similar binding specificity to the human Shc (hShc) PTB domain, but subtle differences were noted; such that the hShc PTB domain bound preferentially to a phosphopeptide from the mammalian nerve growth factor receptor, whereas the dShc PTB domain bound preferentially to phosphopeptides from the Drosophila DER receptor.

The essential physiological functions of ASK1 have attracted extensive attention. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ASK1, including the activation mechanism of ASK1 and the catalytic mechanism of ASK1-mediated MKK phosphorylation, remain unclear.

Here, we report a one-step chromatography method for the expression and purification of functional full-length ASK1 from Escherichia coli. The purified ASK1 demonstrates auto-phosphorylation activity. The kinase activity of auto-phosphorylated ASK1 (pASK1) was also evaluated on two MKK substrates, MKK4 and 7, from the JNK cascades. Our results show that MKK7 can be phosphorylated by pASK1 more effectively than MKK4. The steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrates that MKK7 is a better ASK1 substrate than MKK4. These observations are further confirmed by direct pull-down assays which shows ASK1 binds MKK7 significantly stronger than MKK4.

By virtue of its interaction with these effector proteins CD22 modulates signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor. To define further the molecular mechanism by which CD22 mediates its co-receptor function, phosphopeptide mapping experiments were conducted to determine which of the six tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are involved in recruitment of the stimulatory effector proteins phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, and Syk.

Despite major advances in mass spectrometry, the detection of phosphopeptides by liquid chromatography with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/ES-MS) still remains very challenging in proteomics analysis. Phosphopeptides do not protonate efficiently due to the presence of one or more acidic phosphate groups, making their detection difficult. However, other mechanisms also contribute to the difficulties in phosphopeptide analysis by LC/ES-MS. We report here on one such undocumented problem: the formation of phosphopeptide-metal ion complexes during LC/ES-MS.

The interaction of phosphopeptides with metal ions on the surface of the C18 stationary phase is also shown to alter their chromatographic behavior on reversed-phase columns such that the phosphopeptides, especially multiply phosphorylated peptides, become strongly retained and very difficult to elute. The sources of iron and aluminum are from the solvents, stainless steel, glassware and C18 material. It was also found that, upon addition of EDTA, the formation of the phosphopeptide-metal ion complex is diminished, and the phosphopeptides that did not elute from the LC column can now be detected efficiently as protonated molecules.

The regulation of kinase activity associated with insulin receptor by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been examined using partially purified receptor immobilized on insulin-agarose. The immobilized receptor preparation exhibits predominately tyrosine but also serine and threonine kinase activities toward insulin receptor beta subunit and exogenous histone. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP, followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP, results in a progressive activation of the receptor kinase activity when assayed in the presence of histone and [gamma-32P]ATP. A maximal 4-fold activation is achieved by prior incubation of receptor with concentrations of ATP approaching 1 mM. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of tryptic hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled insulin receptor beta subunit reveals three domains of phosphorylation (designated peaks 1, 2, and 3). Phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues are present in these three domains while peak 2 contains phosphothreonine as well. Thus, at least seven sites are available for phosphorylation on the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Incubation of the phosphorylated insulin receptor with alkaline phosphatase at 15 degrees C results in the selective dephosphorylation of the phosphotyrosine residues on the beta subunit of the receptor while the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine contents are not affected. The dephosphorylation of the receptor is accompanied by a marked 65% inhibition of the receptor kinase activity. Almost 90% of the decrease in [32P]phosphate content of the receptor after alkaline phosphatase treatment is accounted for by a decrease in phosphotyrosine content in peak 2, while very small decreases are observed in peaks 1 and 3, respectively.

Phosphotyrosine and its analogue phenyl phosphate, but not phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or tyrosine itself, blocked recognition of the 90-kDa protein by antiphosphotyrosine antiserum.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 90-kDa protein was detectable within 30 s and reached a plateau within 10 min of FGF addition.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain subunit of smooth muscle myosin (LC20) by the calcium-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C regulates contraction of chemically-permeabilized (glycerinated) porcine carotid artery smooth muscle. Purified protein kinase C and oleic acid were used to phosphorylate LC20 in glycerinated muscles in the presence of a CaEGTA/EGTA buffer system (pCa 8) to prevent activation of myosin light chain kinase. Phosphorylation of the light chain to 1.3 mol of PO4/mol of LC20 did not stimulate contraction. Tryptic digests of glycerinated carotid artery LC20 contained two major phosphopeptides which contained phosphoserine but not phosphothreonine. Incubation of glycerinated muscles with calcium (20 microM) and calmodulin (10 microM) resulted in contraction and LC20 phosphorylation to 1.1 mol of PO4/mol of LC20; tryptic digests of LC20 from these muscles contained a single phosphopeptide which could be distinguished by phosphopeptide mapping from the two phosphopeptides derived from muscles phosphorylated with protein kinase C. Further phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated muscles to 2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20, by incubation with protein kinase C, had no effect on either the level of isometric force or the lightly-loaded shortening velocity (after-load = 0.1 peak active force); removal of Ca2+ and calmodulin, but not protein kinase C and oleic acid, resulted in normal relaxation in spite of maintained phosphorylation to 1.2 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. Comparison of LC20 phosphopeptide maps from glycerinated muscles incubated with protein kinase C plus Ca2+/calmodulin (2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) to maps from intact muscles stimulated with 10(-6) M phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (0.05 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) showed that the same three phosphopeptides were present in both the intact and glycerinated muscles. These findings show that phosphorylation of LC20 by protein kinase C in glycerinated muscles to levels at least 40 times higher than those present during contraction of intact, phorbol ester-stimulated muscles does not activate contraction nor does it significantly modify the contraction of smooth muscle which occurs in response to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of Ser19 by myosin light chain kinase.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 134, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 445, "charStart": 136}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 649, "charStart": 447}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 745, "charStart": 651}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 889, "charStart": 747}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1711, "charStart": 891}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 2067, "charStart": 1713}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 2486, "charStart": 2069}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Autoradiography", "Brain", "Carotid Arteries", "Guinea Pigs", "In Vitro Techniques", "Isometric Contraction", "Kinetics", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Myosin Subfragments", "Peptide Mapping", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C", "Swine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

We compared serum from 10 healthy dogs and 10 dogs affected by B. canis-caused babesiosis with no organ dysfunctions by employing gel-free LC-MS/MS analysis of individual samples and tandem mass tag (TMT) label-based quantitative analyses of pools, both supported by phosphopeptide enrichment. Results showed a moderate number of phosphorylated proteins (50-55), with 89 phosphorylation sites not previously published for dogs although a number of them matched phosphorylation sites found in mammalian orthologs. Three phosphopeptides showed significant variation in babesiosis-affected dog sera compared to controls: Serum amyloid A (SAA) phosphorylated at serine 101 (up-regulation), kininogen 1 phosphorylated at threonine 326, and fibrinogen \u03b1 phosphorylated at both threonine 20 and serine 22 (down-regulation). 71.9% of the detected phosphorylated sites were phosphoserine, 16.8% phosphothreonine and only 11.2% phosphotyrosine residues.

Phosphoserine was the only labelled phosphamino acid detected.

Cdc25A and its catalytic domain (dN25A) demonstrate very similar kinetics toward the artificial substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate (k(cat)/K(m) = 15-25 M(-1) s(-1)) and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.1-1.3 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)). Phospho-peptide substrates exhibit extremely low second-order rate constants and a flat specificity profile toward Cdc25A and dN25A (k(cat)/K(m) = 1 to 10 M(-1) s(-1)). In contrast to peptidic substrates, Cdc25A and dN25A are highly active phosphatases toward the natural substrate, T14- and Y15-bis-phosphorylated Cdk2/CycA complex (Cdk2-pTpY/CycA) with k(cat)/K(m) values of 1.0-1.1 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). In the context of the Cdk2-pTpY/CycA complex, phospho-threonine is preferred over phospho-tyrosine by more than 10-fold. The highly homologous catalytic domain of Cdc25c is essentially inactive toward Cdk2-pTpY/CycA. Taken together these data indicate that a significant degree of the specificity of Cdc25 toward its Cdk substrate resides within the catalytic domain itself and yet is in a region(s) that is outside the phosphate binding site of the enzyme.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 65, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 215, "charStart": 67}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 450, "charStart": 217}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 696, "charStart": 452}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 865, "charStart": 698}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1102, "charStart": 867}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1223, "charStart": 1104}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1319, "charStart": 1225}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1560, "charStart": 1321}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Autoradiography", "Base Sequence", "CDC2-CDC28 Kinases", "Catalysis", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinases", "DNA Primers", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Peptides", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Substrate Specificity", "Xenopus Proteins", "Xenopus laevis", "cdc25 Phosphatases"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

Insulin caused a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the binding of 125I-insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) to the surface of cultured H-35 hepatoma cells. The [32P]phosphate content of the IGF-II receptors, immunoprecipitated from extracts of H-35 cell monolayers previously incubated with [32P]phosphate for 24 h, was decreased after brief exposure of the cells to insulin. Analysis of tryptic digests of labeled IGF-II receptors by bidimensional peptide mapping revealed that the decrease in the content of [32P]phosphate occurred to varying degrees on three tryptic phosphopeptides. Thin layer electrophoresis of an acid hydrolysate of isolated IGF-II receptors revealed the presence of [32P] phosphoserine and [32P]phosphothreonine. Insulin treatment of cells caused a decrease in the labeled phosphoserine and phosphothreonine content of IGF-II receptors. The ability of a number of highly purified protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, phosphorylase kinase, and casein kinase II) to catalyze the phosphorylation of purified IGF-II receptors was examined. Casein kinase II was the only kinase capable of catalyzing the phosphorylation of the IGF-II receptor on serine and threonine residues under the conditions of our assay. Bidimensional peptide mapping revealed that the kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of the IGF-II receptor on a tryptic phosphopeptide which comigrated with the main tryptic phosphopeptide found in receptors obtained from cells labeled in vivo with [32P]phosphate. IGF-II receptors isolated by immunoadsorption from insulin-treated H-35 cells were phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II to a greater extent than the receptors isolated from control cells. Similarly, IGF-II receptors from plasma membranes obtained from insulin-treated adipocytes were phosphorylated by casein kinase II to a greater extent than the receptors from control adipocyte plasma membranes.

Peptide mapping indicated that some of the sites phosphorylated by CaM-kinase II were located on the same phosphopeptides obtained when C-protein was phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (peptides T1, T2, and T3). There was a fourth peptide (T3a) which was unique to CaM-kinase II phosphorylation. 32P-Amino acid analysis showed that essentially all of the 32P of peptides T1, T2, and T3a was in phosphoserine. cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated 32P only into threonine of peptide T3.

Substrates critical for transformation by pp60v-src remain unknown, as does the precise role of the src homology 2 (SH2) domain in this process. To continue exploring the role of the SH2 domain in pp60v-src-mediated transformation, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create mutant v-src alleles predicted to encode proteins with overall structural integrity intact but with reduced ability to bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Arginine-175, which makes critical contacts in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket, was mutated to lysine or alanine. Unexpectedly, both mutations created v-src alleles that transform chicken cells with wild-type (wt) efficiency and are reduced for transformation of rat cells; these alleles are host dependent for transformation. Additionally, these alleles resulted in a round morphological transformation of chicken cells, unlike 12 of the 13 known host-dependent src SH2 mutations that result in a fusiform morphology. Analysis of phosphopeptide binding by the mutant SH2 domains reveal that the in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a high affinity for wt src SH2 correlates with wt (round) morphological transformation in chicken cells and in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a low affinity for wt src SH2 correlates with rat cell transformation.

Mass spectrometry has played a significant role in the identification of unknown phosphoproteins and sites of phosphorylation in biological samples.

Phosphoproteomics has become an important dimension in systems biology studies, and it is essential to have efficient analytical tools to cover a broad range of signaling events. To evaluate current mass spectrometric performance, we present here a novel method to estimate the efficiency of phosphopeptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptides were directly isolated from whole plant cell extracts, dephosphorylated, and then incubated with one of three purified kinases-casein kinase II, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, and SNF-related protein kinase 2.6-along with 16O4- and 18O4-ATP separately for in vitro kinase reactions. Phosphopeptides were enriched and analyzed by LC-MS. The phosphopeptide identification rate was estimated by comparing phosphopeptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry with phosphopeptide pairs generated by stable isotope labeled kinase reactions. Overall, we found that current high speed and high accuracy mass spectrometers can only identify 20%-40% of total phosphopeptides primarily due to relatively poor fragmentation, additional modifications, and low abundance, highlighting the urgent need for continuous efforts to improve phosphopeptide identification efficiency.

This promiscuous recognition is of fundamental interest in chemistry and biology but is challenging when designing phosphopeptides in silico for cell biology studies. To investigate promiscuous recognition and binding processes of phosphopeptides and the modular domain, we selected a domain essential in breast cancer-the breast-cancer-associated protein 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal (BRCT) repeats as our model system. We performed molecular dynamics simulations and detailed analyses of the dihedral space to study protein fluctuation and conformational changes with phosphopeptide binding. We also studied the association processes of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides using Brownian dynamics with a coarse-grained model. We found that the BRCT domain is preorganized for phosphopeptide binding but has a moderate arrangement of side chains to form complexes with various types of phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide binding restricts the system motion in general, while the nonpolar phosphopeptide becomes more flexible in the bound state. Our analysis found that the BRCT domain utilizes different mechanisms, usually termed lock and key, induced-fit, and population-shift/conformational-selection models, to recognize peptides with different features.

In the case where precursor ions cannot be accurately assigned in the survey spectrum (e.g. due to low ion abundance or signal overlap), the mass accuracy of a neutral loss tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis depends on the precursor ion isolation window. For the charge states 2+, 3+ or 4+, a typical 3.5 Da precursor isolation window results in neutral loss windows of 7, 10.5 or 14 Da, respectively. Consequently, neutral loss of 105 Da from alkylated methionine residues can mimic the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-specific neutral loss of 98 Da. In the evaluation of quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) parent ion scan data for neutral loss of H3PO4, this interference was frequently observed. It is illustrated in this study using the analysis of ovalbumin phosphorylation as an example. The +80 Da molecular weight shift connected with phosphorylation at serine or threonine may also be mimicked by carbamidomethylation of methionine through a combination with sodium adduction (+57 Da +22 Da = +79 Da). For highly sensitive neutral loss analysis of serine and threonine phosphorylation, careful data inspection is recommended if reduction and alkylation by IAA is employed.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 190, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 319, "charStart": 192}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 575, "charStart": 321}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 709, "charStart": 577}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 971, "charStart": 711}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1118, "charStart": 973}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1267, "charStart": 1120}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1412, "charStart": 1269}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1507, "charStart": 1414}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1724, "charStart": 1509}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1895, "charStart": 1726}], "mesh": ["Alkylation", "Animals", "Chickens", "Iodoacetamide", "Methionine", "Nanotechnology", "Ovalbumin", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoric Acids", "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Signaling by tyrosine kinases involves direct associations between proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Specificity in signaling pathways results in part from inherent selectivity in interactions between particular SH2 domains and phosphopeptide sequences. The cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 (Syp, PTP 1D, PTP-2C) contains two SH2 domains (N and C) which mediate its association with and activation by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor receptors and IRS-1. We have developed a competitive phosphopeptide binding assay to analyze specificity of the SH-PTP2 N-SH2 domain for phosphorylation sites of these phosphoproteins. The sequence surrounding Tyr1009 bound with greatest affinity (ID50 = 14 microM) of eight PDGF receptor-derived phosphopeptides tested. No peptides corresponding to known epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation sites bound with high affinity. However, an alternative sequence surrounding Tyr954 bound tightly (ID50 = 21 microM). Of the 13 IRS-1-related peptides analyzed, sequences surrounding Tyr546, Tyr895, and Tyr1172 bound with highest affinity (ID50 = 11, 4, and 1 microM, respectively). Alternative phosphopeptides generally bound with much weaker affinity (ID50 > 150 microM). These findings are consistent with recent mutational analyses of the PDGF receptor and predict site-specific interactions between SH-PTP2 and each of these phosphoproteins. Comparisons between peptide sequences suggest that the N-terminal SH2 domain of SH-PTP2 binds with highest affinity to phosphotyrosine (pY) followed by a beta-branched residue (Val, Ile, Thr) at pY+1 and a hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, Ile) at pY+3 positions.

Immobilized metal affinity chromatography and titanium dioxide chromatography can greatly assist selective phosphopeptide enrichment.

Protein phosphorylation represents one of the key regulatory events in physiological insulin secretion from the islet beta-cell. In this context, several classes of protein kinases (e.g. calcium-, cyclic nucleotide- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinases and tyrosine kinases) have been characterized in the beta-cell. The majority of phosphorylated amino acids identified include phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine. Protein histidine phosphorylation has been implicated in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular signal transduction. Most notably, phoshohistidine accounts for 6% of total protein phosphorylation in eukaryotes, which makes it nearly 100-fold more abundant than phosphotyrosine, but less abundant than phosphoserine and phosphothreonine.

The overall objectives of this review are to: (i) summarize the existing evidence indicating the subcellular distribution and characterization of various histidine kinases in the islet beta-cell, (ii) describe evidence for functional regulation of these kinases by agonists of insulin secretion, (iii) present a working model to implicate novel regulatory roles for histidine kinases in the receptor-independent activation, by glucose, of G-proteins endogenous to the beta-cell, (iv) summarize evidence supporting the localization of protein histidine phosphatases in the islet beta-cell and (v) highlight experimental evidence suggesting potential defects in the histidine kinase signalling cascade in islets derived from the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a model for type 2 diabetes.

Identification as ferritin L chain and determination of the RNA/protein binding characteristics. In cultured rat hepatocytes the degradation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA might be regulated by protein(s), which by binding to the mRNA alter its stability. The 3'-untranslated region of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA as a potential target was used to select RNA-binding protein(s) from rat liver by the use of gel retardation assays. A cytosolic protein was isolated, which bound to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA 3'-untranslated region and other in vitro synthesized RNAs. The protein was purified to homogeneity; it had an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa and consisted of identical subunits with an apparent size of 24.5 kDa. Sequence analysis of a tryptic peptide from the 24.5-kDa protein revealed its identity with rat ferritin light chain. Binding of ferritin to RNA was abolished after phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and was augmented after dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Weak binding was observed in extracts from okadaic acid-treated cultured hepatocytes compared with untreated cells. Preincubation of ferritin with an anti-phosphoserine or an anti-phosphothreonine antibody attenuated binding to RNA, while an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody generated a supershift indicating that phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine residues were in close proximity to the RNA-binding region. Ferritin is the iron storage protein in the liver. Binding of ferritin to RNA was diminished in the presence of increasing iron concentrations, whereas the iron chelator desferal was without effect.

A reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatographic system (HPLC) is described that makes possible optimal resolution and quantitation of picomole levels of phosphoamino acids, both with or without the presence of a large excess of nonphosphorylated amino acids. The assay involves precolumn derivatization of an amino acid mixture with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) at room temperature, followed by separation of phosphoamino acids from other amino acids by HPLC. The liquid chromatography was carried out on a C18 reverse-phase column at pH 7.4 and 30 degrees C using gradient elution with eluent A as 157 mM sodium acetate containing 2% acetonitrile and eluent B as 60% acetonitrile in water. A uv absorption at 254 nm is employed for detection of the PITC-derivatized amino acids eluting from the column. Amino acids are eluted with baseline resolution in the following order: phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and phosphotyrosine followed by other amino acids.

That the enzyme is a glycoprotein is surmised from its chromatographic property on Concanavalin A-Sepharose column. An examination of the substrate specificity indicates that the enzyme exhibits a preference for phosphotyrosine over a number of phosphocompounds, including p-nitrophenylphosphate and several glycolytic intermediates. Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The phosphatase activity is not affected by high concentrations of chelating agents and does not require metal ions. Molybdate, orthovanadate, Zn2+, and Hg2+ are all potent inhibitors of the phosphatase activity. The ability of the phosphatase to dephosphorylate protein phosphotyrosine has been investigated. [32P-Tyr]poly(Glu,Tyr)n, [32P-Tyr]alkylated bovine serum albumin, [32P-Tyr]angiotensin-I, and [32P-Tyr]band 3 (from human erythrocyte) are all substrates of the phosphatase. On the other hand, the enzyme has no activity toward protein phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Our result further indicates that the neutral phosphatase is distinct from the wheat germ acid phosphatase. The latter enzyme is found to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl as well as phosphoseryl and phosphothreonyl groups in proteins.

For antibody production, the O-phosphorylated derivative of tyrosine, threonine, or serine was covalently linked to succinylated bovine albumin via the carbodiimide reaction. Each conjugate was then complexed with methylated bovine albumin for immunization of rabbits. To determine binding, the corresponding O-phosphorylated [3H]amino acids were chemically synthesized. In addition, these 3H-phosphorylated derivatives were acylated (with succinic or acetic anhydride) to obtain ligands whose structures resemble those present in the immunogen. The acylated ligands bound to their respective antibodies more effectively: in some cases binding was about three orders of magnitude greater than their non-acylated counterparts. Radioimmunoassays were therefore developed using the N-succinyl-[3H]phosphoamino acids.

{"text": "Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the BRI1 Receptor Kinase Occurs via a Post-Translational Modification and is Activated by the Juxtamembrane Domain. In metazoans, receptor kinases control many essential processes related to growth and development and response to the environment. The receptor kinases in plants and animals are structurally similar but evolutionarily distinct and thus while most animal receptor kinases are tyrosine kinases the plant receptor kinases are classified as serine/threonine kinases. One of the best studied plant receptor kinases is Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1), which functions in brassinosteroid signaling. Consistent with its classification, BRI1 was shown in early studies to autophosphorylate in vitro exclusively on serine and threonine residues and subsequently numerous specific phosphoserine and phosphothreonine sites were identified. However, several sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation have recently been identified establishing that BRI1 is a dual-specificity kinase. This raises the paradox that BRI1 contains phosphotyrosine but was only observed to autophosphorylate on serine and threonine sites. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine (and presumably serine) residues is a post-translational modification, ruling out a co-translational mechanism that could explain the paradox. Moreover, we show that in general, autophosphorylation of the recombinant protein appears to be hierarchical and proceeds in the order: phosphoserine\u2009>\u2009phosphothreonine\u2009>\u2009phosphotyrosine. This may explain why tyrosine autophosphorylation was not observed in some studies. Finally, we also show that the juxtamembrane domain of BRI1 is an activator of the kinase domain, and that kinase specificity (serine/threonine versus tyrosine) can be affected by residues outside of the kinase domain. This may have implications for identification of signature motifs that distinguish serine/threonine kinases from dual-specificity kinases.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 142}, "docId": "22891071", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 142, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 273, "charStart": 144}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 505, "charStart": 275}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 639, "charStart": 507}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 875, "charStart": 641}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1013, "charStart": 877}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1146, "charStart": 1015}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1377, "charStart": 1148}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1565, "charStart": 1379}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1649, "charStart": 1567}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1868, "charStart": 1651}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2007, "charStart": 1870}]}

We demonstrate that in human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells, the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide reciprocally down- and up-regulate, respectively, TEF-mediated GGAATG core enhancer activity. In vitro TEF-1 phosphorylation with several PKC isozymes and phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that TEF-1 is a potential PKC substrate. TEF-1.DNA complexes formed by BeWo nuclear extracts are supershifted by phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine- but not phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, indicating that TEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo at serine and threonine residues. The TEF-1 phosphorylation domain was localized to the third alpha-helix of the DNA binding domain and adjacent hinge region by phosphopeptide analysis.

Thus, assessing the function of these enzymes necessitates the need for a robust, sensitive assay that accurately measures their activities. The authors present a novel, homogeneous, and nonradioactive assay to measure the enzyme activity of low concentrations of several protein phosphatases (phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatases and phosphotyrosine phosphatases).

{"text": "Mechanism of PhosphoThreonine/Serine Recognition and Specificity for Modular Domains from All-atom Molecular Dynamics. BACKGROUND: Phosphopeptide-binding domains mediate many vital cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein recognition. We studied three well-known domains important for signal transduction: BRCT repeats, WW domain and forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. The first two recognize both phosphothreonine (pThr) and phosphoserine (pSer) residues, but FHA has high specificity for pThr residues. Here we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how FHA exclusively chooses pThr and how BRCT and WW recognize both pThr/pSer. The work also investigated the energies and thermodynamic information of intermolecular interactions. RESULTS: Simulations carried out included wide-type and mutated systems. Through analysis of MD simulations, we found that the conserved His residue defines dual loops feature of the FHA domain, which creates a small cavity reserved for only the methyl group of pThr. These well-organized loop interactions directly response to the pThr binding selectivity, while single loop (the 2nd phosphobinding site of FHA) or in combination with \u03b1-helix (BRCT repeats) or \u03b2-sheet (WW domain) fail to differentiate pThr/pSer.

The Grb2 SH2 domain binds to Tyr1068 of EGFR and Tyr317 of Shc while its SH3 domains bind to mSos1. Therefore, EGF treatment potentially results in the formation of several multimeric signaling complexes, including EGFR-Grb2-mSos1, EGFR-Shc-Grb2-mSos1, and Shc-Grb2-mSos1, linking the receptor to activation of the Ras GTPase. We have purified Grb2, mSos1, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex to high homogeneity, and used these isolated proteins to obtain binding affinities of mSos1 for Grb2 and of either Grb2 or Grb2-mSos1 for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. mSos1 bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.4 microM; the stoichiometry of the Grb2-mSos1 complex was 1:1. An EGFR-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.7 microM, whereas the Shc-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.2 microM. Since Grb2 exists in a stable complex with mSos1, and both proteins can exist in a constitutive complex in unstimulated cells, we performed phosphopeptide binding studies on the Grb2-mSos1 complex to gain a better understanding of binding events in the intact cell. Grb2-mSos1 bound to both EGFR- and Shc-derived phosphopeptides with higher affinities (KD of 0.3 microM and 31 nM, respectively) than Grb2 alone. These findings suggest that the proximity of mSos1 to Grb2 in the complex can influence the interactions of the Grb2 SH2 domain with phosphopeptides and raise the possibility that in the Grb2-mSos1 complex the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 are not independent of each other but may be indirectly linked by mSos1.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 75, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 230, "charStart": 77}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 330, "charStart": 232}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 557, "charStart": 332}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 789, "charStart": 559}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 884, "charStart": 791}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1026, "charStart": 886}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1292, "charStart": 1028}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1438, "charStart": 1294}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1749, "charStart": 1440}], "mesh": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "GRB2 Adaptor Protein", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Kinetics", "Macromolecular Substances", "Mice", "Molecular Weight", "Phosphopeptides", "Protein Binding", "Proteins", "Recombinant Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Spectrum Analysis", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Estrogen-induced autocrine and paracrine growth factors are thought to stimulate endometrial proliferation. However, the proliferation is arrested at an early secretory phase although the amount of growth factors and their receptors remains constant. These receptors are protein tyrosine kinases which cause activating receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of signalling substances. One inhibitory mechanism is the reverse dephosphorylation by phosphatases hydrolysing phosphotyrosines. Previously, an acid phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was found in endometrial secretory glands. The purpose of this study was to evaluate its characteristics. Catalytic and immunohistochemical techniques were applied on sections obtained from human endometrium and other tissues. Endometrial acid phosphatase hydrolysed phosphotyrosine, not only at acid, but also at neutral pH values. An alternative substrate was alpha-naphthyl phosphate or beta-glycerophosphate but not phosphoserine. Activities were inhibited by tartrate and fluoride but not by formaldehyde.

Human Pin1 is involved in cancer developments and has been a pharmaceutical target. Thus, finding a high-affinity inhibitor of Pin1 has become an attractive topic. The WW domain of human Pin1 can recognize the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-proline (pS/pT-P) motifs, while its PPIase domain catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl bonds to regulate the cell cycle. Here we incorporated a series of 4-substituted proline derivatives into the phosphopeptides and investigated their affinities for the WW domain of Pin1 to develop better inhibitors of Pin1. On the basis of the ligand Myt1-T412 [PPA(pT)PP], we synthesized several phosphopeptides in which the proline residue in the pT-P motif was replaced with various 4-substituted proline derivatives. Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence anisotropy analyses show that the replacement of proline with (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline increases the binding affinity of the peptide. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that a more PPII-like structure of phosphopeptides makes them bind to the WW domain more tightly. Chemical shift perturbation experiments also indicate that (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline interacts with Trp34 of the WW domain in the binding site. Results of molecular modeling further suggested that a strong C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction induced by (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline is important in enhancing the affinity of the peptide for the WW domain.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Protein kinase C (PKC) is well-recognized to modify ligand-gated ion channels such as nicotinic ACh (nACh) receptors by phosphorylating the receptors. The aim of the present study was to obtain direct evidence for PKC activation through nACh receptors. METHODS: Two-electrode voltage-clamp was made to Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant Torpedo nACh receptors. Western blotting using antibodies against phospho-serine and phospho-threonine was carried out in oocytes expressing Torpedo nACh receptors. In situ PKC activation was monitored in cultured rat skeletal muscle cells expressing nACh receptors. RESULTS: In the Xenopus oocyte expression systems, ACh-evoked whole-cell membrane currents through wild-type Torpedo nACh receptors were depressed by GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, while currents through mutant receptors lacking PKC phosphorylation sites was not affected. In the Western blot analysis, ACh produced immunoreactive bands against an anti-phospho-serine or an anti-phospho-threonine antibody in oocytes expressing wild-type Torpedo nACh receptors, and those signals were attenuated by alpha-bungarotoxin, an inhibitor of nACh receptors, or GF109203X. In the in situ PKC assay using cultured rat muscle cells that expressed all the mRNAs for muscle nACh receptor subunits such as the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and e subunit, ACh activated PKC in the presence of atropine, an inhibitor of muscarinic ACh receptors, and the activation was abolished by alpha-bungarotoxin or GF109203X. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that ACh activates PKC through nACh receptors and that in turn, activated PKC constantly enhances ACh receptor responses by phosphorylating the receptors.

The insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase can apparently directly phosphorylate and activate one or more serine kinases. The identities of such serine kinases and their modes of activation are still unclear. We have described a serine kinase (here designated insulin receptor serine (IRS) kinase) from rat liver membranes that co-purifies with IR on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The kinase was activated after phosphorylation of the membrane glycoproteins by casein kinase-1, casein kinase-2, or casein kinase-3 (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 171: 75-83,1990). In this study, IRS kinase was further characterized. The presence of vanadate or phosphotyrosine in reaction mixtures was required for activation to be observed. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are only about 25% as effective as phosphotyrosine, whereas sodium fluoride and molybdate were ineffective in supporting activation. Vanadate and phosphotyrosine support IRS kinase activation by apparently inhibiting phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases present among the membrane glycoproteins. IR beta-subunit, myelin basic protein, and microtubule-associated protein-2 are good substrates for IRS kinase. The kinase prefers Mn2+ (Ka = 1.3 mM) as a metal cofactor. Mg2+ (Ka = 3.3 mM) is only 30% as effective as Mn2+. The kinase activity is stimulated by basic polypeptides, with greater than 30-fold activation achieved with polylysine and protamine. Our results suggest that both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation are required for activation of IRS kinase.

Highly virulent strains of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that delivers the effector protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by members of the oncogenic c-Src and c-Abl host kinases at EPIYA-sequence motifs A, B and D in East Asian-type strains. These phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs serve as recognition sites for various SH2-domains containing human proteins, mediating interactions of CagA with host signaling factors to manipulate signal transduction pathways. Recognition of phospho-CagA is mainly based on the use of commercial pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies that were originally designed to detect phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. Specific anti-phospho-EPIYA antibodies for each of the three sites in CagA are not forthcoming. This study was designed to systematically analyze the detection preferences of each phosphorylated East Asian CagA EPIYA-motif by pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies and to determine a minimal recognition sequence. We synthesized phospho- and non-phosphopeptides derived from each predominant EPIYA-site, and determined the recognition patterns by seven different pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies using Western blotting, and also investigated representative East Asian H. pylori isolates during infection. The results indicate that a total of only 9-11 amino acids containing the phosphorylated East Asian EPIYA-types are required and sufficient to detect the phosphopeptides with high specificity. However, the sequence recognition by the different antibodies was found to bear high variability. From the seven antibodies used, only four recognized all three phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs A, B and D similarly well. Two of the phosphotyrosine antibodies preferentially bound primarily to the phosphorylated motif A and D, while the seventh antibody failed to react with any of the phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs. Control experiments confirmed that none of the antibodies reacted with non-phospho-CagA peptides and in accordance were able to recognize phosphotyrosine proteins in human cells. The results of this study disclose the various binding preferences of commercial anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for phospho-EPIYA-motifs, and are valuable in the application for further characterization of CagA phosphorylation events during infection with H. pylori and risk prediction for gastric disease development.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 151, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 331, "charStart": 153}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 505, "charStart": 333}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 720, "charStart": 507}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 900, "charStart": 722}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 996, "charStart": 902}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1206, "charStart": 998}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1495, "charStart": 1208}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1688, "charStart": 1497}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1786, "charStart": 1690}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1904, "charStart": 1788}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2098, "charStart": 1906}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2277, "charStart": 2100}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2597, "charStart": 2279}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Antibodies", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cell Line", "Gastric Mucosa", "Helicobacter Infections", "Helicobacter pylori", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Sequence Alignment", "Signal Transduction", "Stomach", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Type IV Secretion Systems"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}
{"text": "Influence of the metals and ligands in dinuclear complexes on phosphopeptide sequencing by electron-transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation is one of the most important protein modifications, and electron-transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (ETD-MS/MS) is a potentially useful method for the sequencing of phosphopeptides, including determination of the phosphorylation site. Notably, ETD-MS/MS typically provides useful information when the precursor contains more than three positive charges. It is not yet used as an analysis method for large-scale phosphopeptide production due to difficulties occurring in the production of acidic phosphopeptides having more than three positive charges. To increase the charge state of phosphopeptides, we used dinuclear metal complexes, which selectively bind to the phosphate group in phosphopeptides with the addition of positive charge(s). Dinuclear copper, zinc, and gallium complexes were tested and it was found that the type of metal present in the complex strongly affected the affinity of the phosphorylated compounds and their ETD fragmentation. The dinuclear copper complex interacted weakly with the phosphate groups and ETD-induced peptide fragmentation was largely suppressed by the presence of Cu2+, which worked as an electron trap. The dinuclear gallium complex was strongly bound to a phosphate group. However, the ligand binding to gallium acted as an electron trap and the presence of dinuclear gallium complex in the precursor for ETD-MS/MS hampered the sequencing of the phosphopeptides, as in the case of dinuclear copper complexes. In contrast, dinuclear zinc complexes efficiently bind to phosphopeptides with an increase in the charge state, facilitating phosphopeptide sequencing by ETD-MS/MS. The fragmentation of the ligand and peptide backbone in the dinuclear zinc-phosphopeptide complex were competitively induced by ETD. These processes are influenced by the ligand structure and so the detailed ETD fragmentation pathways were investigated using density functional theory calculations.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 146}, "docId": "30310898", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 146, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 409, "charStart": 148}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 528, "charStart": 411}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 726, "charStart": 530}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 916, "charStart": 728}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1129, "charStart": 918}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1322, "charStart": 1131}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1393, "charStart": 1324}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1629, "charStart": 1395}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1794, "charStart": 1631}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1927, "charStart": 1796}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2093, "charStart": 1929}]}
{"text": "Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Large-Scale Phosphoproteomics with the Production of over 11,000 Phosphopeptides from the Colon Carcinoma HCT116 Cell Line. Phosphoproteomics requires better separation of phosphopeptides to boost the coverage of the phosphoproteome. We argue that an alternative separation method that produces orthogonal phosphopeptide separation to the widely used LC needs to be considered. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is one important alternative because CZE and LC are orthogonal for phosphopeptide separation and because the migration time of peptides in CZE can be accurately predicted. In this work, we coupled strong cation exchange (SCX)-reversed-phase LC (RPLC) to CZE-MS/MS for large-scale phosphoproteomics of the colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line. The CZE-MS/MS-based platform identified 11,555 phosphopeptides. The phosphopeptide data set is at least 100% larger than that from previous CZE-MS/MS studies and will be a valuable resource for building a model for predicting the migration time of phosphopeptides in CZE. Phosphopeptides migrate significantly slower than corresponding unphosphopeptides under acidic conditions of CZE separations and in a normal polarity. According to our modeling data, phosphorylation decreases peptide's charge roughly by one charge unit, resulting in dramatic decrease in electrophoretic mobility. Preliminary investigations demonstrate that electrophoretic mobility of phosphopeptides containing one phosphoryl group can be predicted with the same accuracy as for nonmodified peptides ( R2 \u2248 0.99). The CZE-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS were complementary in large-scale phosphopeptide identifications and produced different phosphosite motifs from the HCT116 cell line.

The ptp gene of Acinetobacter johnsonii was previously reported to encode a low-molecular-mass protein, Ptp, whose amino acid sequence, predicted from the theoretical analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the gene, exhibits a high degree of similarity with those of different eukaryotic and prokaryotic phosphotyrosine-protein phophatases. We have now overexpressed the ptp gene in Escherichia coli cells, purified the Ptp protein to homogeneity by a single-step chromatographic procedure, and analysed its functional properties. We have shown that Ptp can catalyse the dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phosphotyrosine, but has no effect on phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. Its activity is blocked by ammonium molybdate and sodium orthovanadate, which are strong inhibitors of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases, as well as by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetic acid. Such specificity of Ptp for phosphotyrosine has been confirmed by the observation that it can dephosphorylate endogenous proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine, but not proteins modified on either serine or threonine. In addition, Ptp has been shown to quantitatively dephosphorylate two exogenous peptides, derived respectively from leech hirudin and human gastrin, previously phosphorylated on tyrosine. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments performed on Cys11 and Arg16, which are both present in the sequence motif (H/V)C(X5)R(S/T) typical of eukaryotic phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases, have demonstrated that each amino acid residue is essential for the catalytic activity of Ptp. Taken together, these data provide evidence that Ptp is a member of the phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase family.

Enrichment is essential for phosphoproteome analysis because phosphorylated proteins are usually present in cells in low abundance. Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been demonstrated to enrich phosphopeptides from simple peptide mixtures with high specificity; however, the technology has not been optimized. In the present study, significant non-specific bindings were observed when proteome samples were applied to TiO2 columns. Column wash with an NH4Glu solution after loading peptide mixtures significantly increased the efficiency of TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment with a recovery of up to 84%. Also, for proteome samples, more than a 2-fold increase in unique phosphopeptide identifications has been achieved. The use of NH4Glu for a TiO2 column wash does not significantly reduce the phosphopeptide recovery. A total of 858 phosphopeptides corresponding to 1034 distinct phosphosites has been identified from HeLa cells using the improved TiO2 enrichment procedure in combination with data-dependent neutral loss nano-RPLC-MS2-MS3 analysis. While 41 and 35% of the phosphopeptides were identified only by MS2 and MS3, respectively, 24% was identified by both MS2 and MS3.

In the present work, we demostrate that the phosphopeptide enrichment method based on an online continuous pH gradient in a strong anion exchange column (SAX method) is highly complementary to the method based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) affinity enrichment.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a common theme in the regulation of important cellular functions such as growth, metabolism, and differentiation. The comprehensive understanding of biological processes requires the characterization of protein phosphorylation at the molecular level. Although, the number of cellular phosphoproteins is relatively high, the phosphorylated residues themselves are generally of low abundance due to the sub-stoichiometric nature. However, low abundance of phosphopeptides and low degree of phosphorylation typically necessitates isolation and concentration of phosphopeptides prior to mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we used trivalent lanthanide ions (LaCl(3), CeCl(3), EuCl(3), TbCl(3), HoCl(3), ErCl(3), and TmCl(3)) for phosphopeptide enrichment and cleaning-up. Due to their low solubility product, lanthanide ions form stable complexes with the phosphate groups of phosphopeptides and precipitate out of solution. In a further step, non-phosphorylated compounds can easily be removed by simple centrifugation and washing before mass spectrometric analysis using Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight.

Data are presented which indicate that when a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer is used, MALDI can distinguish tyrosine phosphorylation from serine and threonine phosphorylation for peptides containing a single phosphate group. Phosphopeptides are identified in the (+) ion MALDI reflector spectrum by the presence of [MH-H3PO4]+ and [MH-HPO3]+ fragment ions formed by metastable decomposition. An abundant [MH-H3PO4]+ ion, accompanied by a weaker [MH-HPO3]+ ion indicates that the peptide is most likely phosphorylated on serine or threonine. In contrast, phosphotyrosine-containing peptides generally exhibit [MH-HPO3]+ fragment ions and little, if any [MH-H3PO4]+. Ambiguities do arise, most often with phosphopeptides that contain residues which readily lose water (such as unmodified serine), but these can often be resolved by recording a complete metastable fragment ion (postsource decay) spectrum. Postsource decay is shown here to be a viable technique for sequencing phosphopeptides.

The Na/Cl-dependent BGT1 transporter has osmoprotective functions by importing the small osmolyte betaine into the cytosol of renal medullary epithelial cells. We have demonstrated previously that the surface localization of the transporter in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells depends on its association with the LIN7 PDZ protein through a PDZ target sequence in the last 5 residues of the transporter (-KETHL). Here we describe a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated mechanism regulating the association between BGT1 and LIN7. Reduced transport activity paralleled by the intracellular relocalization of the transporter was observed in response to the PKC activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment. This activation caused clathrin-dependent internalization of the transporter and its targeting to a recycling compartment that contains the truncated transporter lacking the LIN7 binding motif (BGTDelta5) but not the LIN7 partner of BGT1. The decreased association between BGT1 and LIN7 was demonstrated further by coimmunoprecipitation studies and in vitro binding to recombinant LIN7 fusion protein. The TPA treatment induced phosphorylation of surface BGT1 on serine and threonine residues. However, a greater increase in phosphothreonines than phosphoserines was measured in the wild type transporter, whereas the opposite was true in the BGTSer mutant in which a serine replaced the threonine 612 in the LIN7 association motif (-KESHL). No similar increase in relative phosphoserines or phosphothreonines was found in the BGTDelta5 transporter. Moreover, phosphorylation of threonine 612 in a BGT COOH-terminal peptide impaired its association with recombinant LIN7. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the post-translational regulation of BGT1 surface density is a result of transporter phosphorylation and that threonine 612 is an essential residue in this PKC-mediated regulation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 220, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 380, "charStart": 222}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 631, "charStart": 382}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 742, "charStart": 633}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 947, "charStart": 744}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1186, "charStart": 949}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1349, "charStart": 1188}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1441, "charStart": 1351}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1689, "charStart": 1443}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1797, "charStart": 1691}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1919, "charStart": 1799}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2144, "charStart": 1921}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Carrier Proteins", "Clathrin-Coated Vesicles", "Dogs", "Epithelial Cells", "GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mice", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C", "Serine", "Threonine", "Vesicular Transport Proteins"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a post-translational modification that regulates all aspect of life through the antagonistic action of kinases and phosphatases. Protein kinases are well characterized, but protein phosphatases have been relatively neglected.

In this review, I will discuss how phosphatases were discovered, how the view that they were unselective emerged and how recent findings have revealed their exquisite selectivity. Unlike kinases, PP1 phosphatases are obligatory heteromers composed of a catalytic subunit bound to one (or two) non-catalytic subunit(s). Based on an in-depth study of two holophosphatases, I propose the following: selective dephosphorylation depends on the assembly of two components, the catalytic subunit and the non-catalytic subunit, which serves as a high-affinity substrate receptor. Because functional complementation of the two modules is required to produce a selective holophosphatase, one can consider that they are split enzymes. The non-catalytic subunit was often referred to as a regulatory subunit, but it is, in fact, an essential component of the holoenzyme. In this model, a phosphatase and its array of mostly orphan substrate receptors constitute the split protein phosphatase system.

Regulated exocytosis of neutrophil intracellular storage granules is necessary for neutrophil participation in the inflammatory response. The signal transduction pathways that participate in neutrophil exocytosis are complex and poorly defined. Several protein kinases, including p38 MAPK and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Hck and Fgr, participate in this response. However, the downstream targets of these kinases that regulate exocytosis are unknown. The present study combined a novel inhibitor of neutrophil exocytosis with proteomic techniques to identify phosphopeptides and phosphoproteins from a population of gelatinase and specific granules isolated from unstimulated and fMLF-stimulated neutrophils. To prevent loss of granule-associated phosphoproteins upon exocytosis, neutrophils were pretreated with a TAT-fusion protein containing a SNARE domain from SNAP-23 (TAT-SNAP-23), which inhibited fMLF-stimulated CD66b-containing granule exocytosis by 100\u00b110%. Following TAT-SNAP-23 pretreatment, neutrophils were stimulated with the chemotactic peptide fMLF for 0 min, 1 min, and 2 min. Granules were isolated by gradient centrifugation and subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin to obtain peptides from the outer surface of the granule. Phosphopeptides were enriched by gallium or TiO2 affinity chromatography, and phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites were identified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem MS. This resulted in the identification of 243 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 235 proteins, including known regulators of vesicle trafficking. The analysis identified 79 phosphoproteins from resting neutrophils, 81 following 1 min of fMLF stimulation, and 118 following 2 min of stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis identified a potential Src tyrosine kinase motif from a phosphopeptide corresponding to G protein coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5). Phosphorylation of GRK5 by Src was confirmed by an in vitro kinase reaction and by precursor ion scanning for phospho-tyrosine specific immonium ions containing Tyr251 and Tyr253.

IMAC strategy is widely used in phosphopeptide enrichment, but most of the current eluents contain large amount of salt, which must be discarded before MS detection. Here, we present techniques to elute phosphopeptides with low ionization efficiency reagents, which could be left in the eluate for direct MS analysis, thus saving desalting and the following steps. Several reagents were studied, including 5-sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate, acetyl acetone and glyphosate. The results show that glyphosate has very outstanding advantages: only monophosphopeptides can be eluted with glyphosate solution, while all phosphopeptides can be eluted with negatively charged glyphosate ions with pH9. Moreover, the high ionic strength can minimize nonspecific electrostatic interactions in elution step and limit the generation of potential phosphopeptide-metal ion adducts such as sodium or Fe(3+) counterparts. S/N of phosphopeptides could be enhanced 3-5 folds in MALDI MS detection and phosphopeptide recovery is greatly improved while compared with its counterparts eluted by commonly used elution buffers. By applying this reagent into IMAC elution, the whole experimental process could be more convenient, time-saving and cost-saving, which is of great importance to the enrichment and detection of phosphopeptides in phosphoproteomics research.

The length of the phosphopeptides is more important for PP2A(D) than for PTP-1B, C-terminal acidic residues adjacent to the phosphotyrosine are detrimental for the PTPase activity of PP2A(D), but they do not affect the PTP-1B activity. Acidic residues at the --2 and --3 position relative to Tyr(P) primarily dictate dephosphorylation by PTP-1B. The higher-order structure of the protein substrates also differentially influences both enzymes: the phospho-octapeptide KDDEYpNPA, which reproduces the autophosphorylation site in c-Fgr (Tyr400), is only dephosphorylated by PP2A(D) if embedded in the intact protein, whereas the opposite is true for PTP-1B. Both the intact p50/HS1 phosphoprotein and the derived phosphopeptide are substrates only for PTP-1B and not for PP2A(D). Lyn and c-Fgr phosphorylated by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) at their down-regulatory site are resistant to the action of both PTPases while the [Phe6]Src-(514-533) phosphopeptide, representing the highly similar site affected by CSK in c-Src, is readily dephosphorylated by both PTPases, although to a different extent. In vitro dephosphorylation of the c-Fgr Tyr400 site by PP2A(D) is correlated with a decreased tyrosine kinase activity towards exogenous substrates. Under experimental conditions in which both Tyr400 (autophosphorylation site) and Tyr511 (down-regulatory site) of c-Fgr are phosphorylated, PP2A(D) can reverse both phosphorylations.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 204, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 662, "charStart": 206}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 742, "charStart": 664}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 978, "charStart": 744}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1088, "charStart": 980}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1398, "charStart": 1090}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1520, "charStart": 1400}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1840, "charStart": 1522}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1989, "charStart": 1842}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 2173, "charStart": 1991}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Peptide Mapping", "Peptides", "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases", "Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Rabbits", "Substrate Specificity", "src-Family Kinases"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The mechanism for these dephosphorylation reactions was investigated. Dephosphorylation was inhibited by a competitive inhibitor for the ATP binding site. In the presence of ADP, dephosphorylation of phosphopeptide substrates is primarily due to the reversal of the kinase reaction. Autoactivated and unactivated srcTK both catalyzed the reverse of the kinase reaction; however, autoactivated srcTK displayed an increase in kcat of approximately 4-11-fold relative to unactivated srcTK, depending on the reaction conditions. Autoactivation of srcTK does not affect the Km's for MgADP or phosphopeptide (FGE)3-pY-(GEF)2GD. Unphosphorylated srcTK becomes phosphorylated during the reverse of the kinase reaction upon accumulation of free MgATP. In the presence of MgATP, srcTK also dephosphorylates peptide substrates, by first hydrolyzing MgATP to MgADP. Binding of phosphotyrosine peptide ligands to the src SH2 domain stimulated the rate of MgATP hydrolysis approximately 2-fold, but had not effect on the Km for MgATP.

The binding of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to tyrosyl phosphopeptides depends on electrostatic interactions between the phosphotyrosine and its binding site. To probe the role of these interactions, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the pH dependence of the binding of the SH2 domain of the Src kinase to a high-affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide. Two independent approaches were employed. In a first series of experiments that focused on determining the peptide's association constant between pH 5.0 and 9.0, two ionizable groups were characterized. One group, with free and bound pKas of 6.2 and 4.4, respectively, could be identified as the phosphate in the phosphotyrosine while the other group, with free and bound pKas of 8.2 and 8.5, respectively, could be only tentatively assigned to a cysteine in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket. Further information on the linkage between peptide binding and protonation of the phosphotyrosine was obtained from a second series of experiments, which focused on determining the peptide binding enthalpy at low values of pH in several buffers with different ionization enthalpies. These data provided free and bound pKa values for the phosphotyrosine identical to those derived from the first series of experiments, and hence demonstrated for the first time that the two approaches provide identical information regarding proton linkage. In addition, the second series of experiments also determined the intrinsic enthalpy of binding of both the protonated and deprotonated phosphate forms of the peptide. These two sets of experiments provided a complete energetic profile of the linkage between phosphate ionization and peptide binding.

PURPOSE: A major pathway for intracellular signaling from cell surface receptors, such as integrins, involves intracellular phosphorylation. In corneal fibroblasts, the authors have investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin-dependent cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. METHODS: Antibodies were used to detect phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, including focal adhesion kinase in lysates and immunoprecipitates of corneal fibroblasts. The authors used anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to localize phosphotyrosines in fixed cultured corneal fibroblasts. Similarly, immunocytochemical detection of vinculin was used to identify focal adhesions, the subcellular structures in which integrins organize attachment to matrix extracellularly and to cytoskeletal components intracellularly. RESULTS: Suspension of corneal fibroblasts produced a dramatic decrease in detectable phosphotyrosines. During integrin-dependent fibroblast attachment to exogenously supplied fibronectin, the cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), pp125FAK, became tyrosine phosphorylated. However, FAK was not phosphorylated during fibroblast attachment to vitronectin or polylysine or when cells were kept in suspension. In addition, the treatment of suspended cells with antibody to the extracellular domain of fibronectin receptor caused FAK phosphorylation. Phosphotyrosine was colocalized with vinculin in newly formed focal adhesions. Focal adhesion formation was prevented by herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases.

Conjugating a phosphoserine to the C-terminal of a well-established self-assembling peptide backbone, (naphthalene-2-ly)-acetyl-diphenylalanine (NapFF), affords a novel hydrogelation precursor for EISA. The incorporation of phosphotyrosine, another substrate of phosphatase, into the resulting precursor, provides one more enzymatic trigger on a single molecule, and meanwhile increases the precursors' propensity to aggregate after being fully dephosphorylated. Exchanging the positions of phosphorylated serine and tyrosine in the peptide backbone provides insights on how the specific molecular structures influence self-assembling behaviors of small peptides and the subsequent cellular responses. Moreover, the utilization of D-amino acids largely enhances the biostability of the peptides, thus providing a unique soft material for potential biomedical applications.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 132}, "docId": "29403673", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 132, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 317, "charStart": 134}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 473, "charStart": 319}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 695, "charStart": 475}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 898, "charStart": 697}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1158, "charStart": 900}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1397, "charStart": 1160}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1568, "charStart": 1399}]}

Phosphopeptide enrichment from complicated peptide mixtures is an essential step for mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic studies to reduce sample complexity and ionization suppression effects. Typical methods for enriching phosphopeptides include immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) or titanium dioxide (TiO2) beads, which have selective affinity and can interact with phosphopeptides. In this study, the IMAC enrichment method was compared with the TiO2 enrichment method, using a multistep enrichment strategy from whole cell lysate, to evaluate their abilities to enrich for different types of phosphopeptides. The peptide-to-beads ratios were optimized for both IMAC and TiO2 beads. Both IMAC and TiO2 enrichments were performed for three rounds to enable the maximum extraction of phosphopeptides from the whole cell lysates. The phosphopeptides that are unique to IMAC enrichment, unique to TiO2 enrichment, and identified with both IMAC and TiO2 enrichment were analyzed for their characteristics. Both IMAC and TiO2 enriched similar amounts of phosphopeptides with comparable enrichment efficiency. However, phosphopeptides that are unique to IMAC enrichment showed a higher percentage of multiphosphopeptides as well as a higher percentage of longer, basic, and hydrophilic phosphopeptides. Also, the IMAC and TiO2 procedures clearly enriched phosphopeptides with different motifs.

Four commercially available immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) methods for phosphopeptide enrichment were compared using small volumes and concentrations of phosphopeptide mixtures with or without extra-added bovine serum albumin (BSA) nonphosphorylated peptides. Addition of abundant tryptic BSA peptides to the phosphopeptide mixture increases the demand for selective IMAC capture. While SwellGel gallium Discs, IPAC Metal Chelating Resin, and ZipTipMC Pipette Tips allow for the possibility of enriching phosphopeptides, the Gyrolab MALDI IMAC1 also presents the possibility of verifying existing phosphopeptides after a dephosphorylation step. Phosphate-containing peptides are identified through a mass shift between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated spectra of 80 Da (or multiples of 80 Da). This verification is useful if the degree of phosphorylation is low in the sample or if the ionization is unfavorable, which often is the case for phosphopeptides. A peptide mixture in which phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine were represented was diluted in steps and thereafter enriched using the four different IMAC methods prior to analyses with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.

This review discusses the enrichment of phosphopeptides with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, reversible covalent binding, and metal oxide affinity chromatography. Capture of phosphopeptides on TiO(2) seems especially promising in terms of selectivity and recovery, but the success of all methods depends on careful selection of binding, washing, and elution solutions. Enrichment techniques are complementary, such that a combination of methods greatly enhances the number of phosphopeptides isolated from complex samples. Development of a standard series of phosphopeptides in a highly complex mixture of digested proteins would greatly aid the comparison of different enrichment methods. Phosphopeptide binding to magnetic beads and on-plate isolation prior to MALDI-MS are emerging as convenient methods for purification of small (microL) samples. On-plate enrichment can yield >70% recoveries of phosphopeptides in mixtures of a few digested proteins and can avoid sample-handling steps, but this technique is likely limited to relatively simple samples such as immunoprecipitates.

Accurate determination of protein phosphorylation is challenging, particularly for researchers who lack access to a high-accuracy mass spectrometer. In this study, multiple protocols were used to enrich phosphopeptides, and a rigorous filtering workflow was used to analyze the resulting samples. Phosphopeptides were enriched from cultured rat renal proximal tubule cells using three commonly used protocols and a dual method that combines separate immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) chromatography, termed dual IMAC (DIMAC). Phosphopeptides from all four enrichment strategies were analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple levels of mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) neutral-loss scanning using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the resulting MS(2) and MS(3) spectra were analyzed using PeptideProphet and database search engine thresholds that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1.5% when searched against a reverse database. However, only 40% of the potential phosphopeptides were confirmed by manual validation. The combined analyses yielded 110 confidently identified phosphopeptides. Using less-stringent initial filtering thresholds (FDR of 7-9%), followed by rigorous manual validation, 262 unique phosphopeptides, including 111 novel phosphorylation sites, were identified confidently. Thus, traditional methods of data filtering within widely accepted FDRs were inadequate for the analysis of low-resolution phosphopeptide spectra.

Recent advances in instrument control and enrichment procedures have enabled us to quantify large numbers of phosphoproteins and record site-specific phosphorylation events. An intriguing problem that has arisen with these advances is to accurately validate where phosphorylation events occur, if possible, in an automated manner. The problem is difficult because MS/MS spectra of phosphopeptides are generally more complicated than those of unmodified peptides. For large scale studies, the problem is even more evident because phosphorylation sites are based on single peptide identifications in contrast to protein identifications where at least two peptides from the same protein are required for identification. To address this problem we have developed an integrated strategy that increases the reliability and ease for phosphopeptide validation. We have developed an off-line titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) selective phosphopeptide enrichment procedure for crude cell lysates. Following enrichment, half of the phosphopeptide fractionated sample is enzymatically dephosphorylated, after which both samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS. From the resulting MS/MS analyses, the dephosphorylated peptide is used as a reference spectrum against the original phosphopeptide spectrum, in effect generating two peptide spectra for the same amino acid sequence, thereby enhancing the probability of a correct identification. The integrated procedure is summarized as follows: 1) enrichment for phosphopeptides by TiO(2) chromatography, 2) dephosphorylation of half the sample, 3) LC-MS/MS-based analysis of phosphopeptides and corresponding dephosphorylated peptides, 4) comparison of peptide elution profiles before and after dephosphorylation to confirm phosphorylation, and 5) comparison of MS/MS spectra before and after dephosphorylation to validate the phosphopeptide and its phosphorylation site. This phosphopeptide identification represents a major improvement as compared with identifications based only on single MS/MS spectra and probability-based database searches.

During mitosis, phosphorylation of spindle associated proteins is a key regulatory mechanism for spindle formation, mitotic progression, and cytokinesis.

Here, we present a quantitative comparison of spindle phosphoproteomes prepared from different mitotic stages. In total, we report the identification and SILAC based relative quantitation of 1940 unique phosphorylation sites and find that late mitosis (anaphase, telophase) is correlated with a drastic alteration in protein phosphorylation.

Pinning and evaporation of a sample droplet on the microspot concentrate samples and enrich phosphopeptides through binding to the small area. After rinsing with acidic solution to remove unwanted peptides, a drop of matrix solution elutes the phosphopeptides and crystallizes only on the microspot. With beta-casein and ovalbumin digests, the use of microspots rather than 2 mm-diameter polymer spots for phosphopeptide enrichment results in a 5-fold decrease in MALDI-MS detection limits and low-femtomole level sensitivity.

Unlike MOAC techniques, IMAC requires rather complete removals of buffering reagents, salts and high concentrations of denaturant prior to sample loading in order for the successful enrichment of phosphopeptides. In this study, a simple off-line capillary column-based IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment method can shorten sample preparation time by eliminating the speed-vac step from the desalting process. Tryptic digest peptide samples containing 2M urea can be directly processed and the entire IMAC procedure can be completed within 6 h. When tryptic digest peptide samples prepared from mouse whole brain tissues were analyzed using our method, an average of 249 phosphoproteins and 463 unique phosphopeptides were identified from single 2-h RPLC-MS/MS analysis (~88% specificity). An additional advantage of this method is the significantly improved reproducibility of the phosphopeptide enrichment results. When four independent phosphopeptide enrichment experiments were carried out, the peak areas of phosphopeptides identified among four enrichment experiments were relatively similar (less than 16.2% relative standard dev.).

Phosphorylation-mediated signaling pathways have major implications in cellular regulation and disease.

As such, the efficient enrichment, and subsequent recovery of phosphorylated peptides, is vital. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a well-established approach for quantifying thousands of phosphorylation events in a single experiment. We designed a peptide internal standard-based assay directed toward sample preparation strategies for mass spectrometry analysis to understand better phosphopeptide recovery from enrichment strategies. We coupled mass-differential tandem mass tag (mTMT) reagents (specifically, TMTzero and TMTsuper-heavy), nine mass spectrometry-amenable phosphopeptides (phos9), and peak area measurements from extracted ion chromatograms to determine phosphopeptide recovery. We showcase this mTMT/phos9 recovery assay by evaluating three phosphopeptide enrichment workflows. Our assay provides data on the recovery of phosphopeptides, which complement other metrics, namely the number of identified phosphopeptides and enrichment specificity.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins is a common regulatory mechanism, although it accounts for less than 1% of the total O-phosphate content in proteins. Whereas aromatic phosphorylation sites can be identified by a number of different analytical techniques, sequence analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins at the low picomole or even femtomole level is still a challenging task. This paper describes the post-source decay in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of phosphotyrosine-containing model peptides by comparing their fragmentation behavior with sequence-homologous unphosphorylated peptides. Whereas the parent ions showed significant losses of HPO3, all phosphorylated fragment ions of the b- and y-series displayed only minor dephosphorylated signals, which often were not detectable. Surprisingly, one of the studied phosphotyrosine-containing sequences displayed, in addition to the [M + H - 80]+ ion, a more abundant [M + H - 98]+ ion, which could be explained by elimination of phosphoric acid. This dephosphorylation pattern was very similar to the patterns obtained for phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptides. Because the dephosphorylation pattern of the parent ion is often used to identify modified amino acids in peptides, we investigated possible dephosphorylation mechanisms in detail. Therefore, we substituted single trifunctional amino acid residues and incorporated deuterated phosphotyrosine residues. After excluding direct elimination of phosphoric acid from tyrosine, we could show that the obtained loss of H3PO4 depends on aspartic acid and arginine residues. Most likely the HPO3 group is transferred to aspartic acid followed by cleavage of phosphoric acid forming a succinimide. On the other hand, arginine appears to induce the H3PO4 loss by protonation of phosphotyrosine leaving a phenyl cation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 143, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 310, "charStart": 145}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 545, "charStart": 312}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 792, "charStart": 547}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 987, "charStart": 794}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1201, "charStart": 989}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1335, "charStart": 1203}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1516, "charStart": 1337}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1637, "charStart": 1518}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1800, "charStart": 1639}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1922, "charStart": 1802}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2042, "charStart": 1924}], "mesh": ["Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotyrosine", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

The peptide-to-IMAC ratio was optimized to maximize IMAC performance, while multistep IMAC enrichment enabled improved phosphopeptide acquisition.

{"text": "Phosphopeptide enrichment with cross-linked Os(II)(dmebpy)2 Cl-derivatized acrylamide and vinylimidazole copolymer. RATIONALE: Reversible phosphorylation of proteins catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases plays a key regulatory role in intracellular biological processes. Protein phosphorylation profiling is still a challenge due to its low stoichiometry, diversity of phosphorylated protein forms, and dynamic nature of phosphorylation states. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been widely used for the characterization of protein phosphorylation, due to its high sensitivity and MS/MS sequencing capability. However, the low abundance and ionization efficiency of phosphorylated peptides and interference from their non-phosphorylated counterparts and other peptides in the enzymatic digests of proteins complicate the localization of phosphorylation sites in liquid chromatography (LC)/MS analysis. So the enrichment of phosphopeptides from the digests is often required before LC/MS. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) are the two most commonly used enrichment techniques for phosphopeptides prior to MS analysis. METHODS: Cross-linked Os(II)(4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine)2 Cl-derivatized acrylamide and vinylimidazole copolymer were applied for the enrichment of phosphopeptides. RESULTS: Under neutral loading buffer conditions phosphopeptides bind on the Os-polymer without nonspecific binding of acidic peptides. Differential binding of monophosphorylated and multiply phosphorylated peptides can be achieved under different concentrations of imidazole. Sequential elution of bound phosphopeptides can be obtained with elution buffers of different pH values below 3. The loading buffers with imidazole can be aqueous or 7/3 H2 O/ACN. Once phosphopeptides bind onto the Os-polymer, washing with water, 0.1% acetic acid (pH\u00a0~\u00a03) or 1/1 H2 O/ACN 0.05% acetic acid (pH ~3) does not elute phosphopeptides. The Os-polymer does not show bias of binding and elution toward phosphopeptide standards with singly, doubly and triply phosphorylated sites. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-linked Os(II)(dimethylbipyridine)2 Cl-derivatized poly(acrylamide)-poly(vinylimidazole) copolymer is proven to be a new efficient IMAC resin for phosphopeptide enrichment and shows some unique properties for differential binding and sequential elution of phosphopeptides.

Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification of proteins that plays very important role in a large number of biological processes. However, despite recent advancements in phosphoproteome research, large-scale detection and characterization of phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry (MS) is still a challenging task due to the low abundance of phosphopeptides and sub-stoichiometric nature of phosphorylation sites. On-particle microwave-assisted trypsin digestion of phosphoproteins and enrichment of phosphopeptides is an effective method for identification/characterization of phosphopeptides. Magnetic nanoparticles typically can absorb microwave radiation and generate heat in order to resolve complex phosphproteins and to enhance the digestion rate and capture the phosphopeptides on their modified surfaces. In this study, we used a cheap and efficient method for rapid microwave-assisted tryptic digestion of phosphoproteins and simultaneous enrichment of phosphopeptides using CoFe2 O4 -ZnO magnetic nanoparticles. Using this technique, the digestion time of phosphoproteins can be reduced and the phosphopeptides can be quickly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). For the first time, we have applied CoFe2 O4 -ZnO magnetic nanoparticles for enrichment of phosphopeptides from standard phosphoproteins (\u03b2-casein and ovalbumin), complex samples (human serum and egg white) and a protein mixture of \u03b2-casein and BSA (1:100). Our results demonstrate that the capture efficiency of CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles for \u03b2-casein and ovalbumin in MALDI-TOFMS is very high (detection limits 0.2 fmol and 20 fmol, respectively). The CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles have high affinity for phosphopeptide enrichment for \u03b2-casein in complex mixtures with BSA at 1:10 and 1:100 molar ratios in the microwave within 30 s. Compared with other reported magnetic nanoparticles, the CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles are easy to prepare and handle, and can save time in the phosphopeptide enrichment procedure, making these nanoparticle a good choice for highly sensitive phosphopeptide enrichment.

The mass spectrometric analysis of protein phosphorylation is still far from being routine, and the outcomes thereof are often unsatisfying.

Here we present the results of a study investigating the validity of these three arguments when using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

Over the past years, phosphoproteomics has advanced to a prime tool in signaling research. Since then, an enormous amount of information about in vivo protein phosphorylation events has been collected providing a treasure trove for gaining a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in cell signaling. Yet, we still face the problem of how to achieve correct modification site localization. Here we use alternative fragmentation and different bioinformatics approaches for the identification and confident localization of phosphorylation sites. Phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed by multistage activation, collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), yielding complementary phosphopeptide identifications. We further found that MASCOT, OMSSA and Andromeda each identified a distinct set of phosphopeptides allowing the number of site assignments to be increased. The postsearch engine SLoMo provided confident phosphorylation site localization, whereas different versions of PTM-Score integrated in MaxQuant differed in performance. Based on high-resolution ETD and higher collisional dissociation (HCD) data sets from a large synthetic peptide and phosphopeptide reference library reported by Marx et al. [Nat.

Additional analyses of HCD data demonstrated that for phosphotyrosine peptides and phosphopeptides containing two potential phosphorylation sites, PTM-Score probability cutoff values of <1 can be applied to ensure an FLR of 1%.

Tyrosine phosphorylation is an important regulator of signaling in cellular pathways, and dysregulated tyrosine phosphorylation causes several diseases. Mass spectrometry has revealed the importance of global phosphoproteomic characterization. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation by studying the mass-spectrometry (MS)-determined phosphoproteome remains difficult because of the relatively low abundance of tyrosine phosphoproteins. To effectively evaluate tyrosine-phosphopeptide enrichment and reduce ion suppression from non-phosphorylated peptides in MS analysis, three trypsin-digested BSA peptides and 14 standard phosphopeptides, including six tyrosine phosphopeptides, four serine phosphopeptides, and four threonine phosphopeptides, were subjected to titanium dioxide immunoaffinity-based enrichment and also to combined enrichment using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses. The enrichment factors were evaluated to determine the efficiency of each enrichment procedure. Comparison of five optimized enrichment methods, including TiO2-based immunoaffinity purification in Tris and MOPS buffer systems, TiO2-immunoaffinity enrichment, and immunoaffinity-TiO2 enrichment for total tyrosine, serine and threonine phosphopeptides, revealed that the order of the enrichment factors for total tyrosine phosphopeptides is: (i) immunoaffinity-TiO2 (enrichment factor\u2009=\u200938,244), (ii) TiO2-immunoaffinity (enrichment factor\u2009=\u200924,987), (iii) TiO2 micro-column (enrichment factor\u2009=\u200910,305), (iv) immunoaffinity in Tris buffer system (enrichment factor\u2009=\u20091450), and (v) immunoaffinity in the MOPS buffer system (enrichment factor\u2009=\u200932).

Nonenzymatic post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is a fundamental molecular process of aging. The combination of various modifications and their accumulation with age not only affects function, but leads to crosslinking and protein aggregation. In this study, aged human lens proteins were examined using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry and a blind PTM search strategy. Multiple thioether modifications of Ser and Thr residues by glutathione (GSH) and its metabolites were unambiguously identified. Thirty-four of 36 sites identified on 15 proteins were found on known phosphorylation sites, supporting a mechanism involving dehydroalanine (DHA) and dehydrobutyrine (DHB) formation through \u03b2-elimination of phosphoric acid from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine with subsequent nucleophilic attack by GSH. In vitro incubations of phosphopeptides demonstrated that this process can occur spontaneously under physiological conditions. Evidence that this mechanism can also lead to protein-protein crosslinks within cells is provided where five crosslinked peptides were detected in a human cataractous lens. Nondisulfide crosslinks were identified for the first time in lens tissue between \u03b2B2- & \u03b2B2-, \u03b2A4- & \u03b2A3-, \u03b3S- & \u03b2B1-, and \u03b2A4- & \u03b2A4-crystallins and provide detailed structural information on in vivo crystallin complexes.

BACKGROUND: Src homology 2 (SH2) domains mediate protein/protein interactions by binding phosphotyrosyl proteins with high specificity. The protein Lck, a Src-like lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase which is important in signals involved in T-cell development, contains one such domain. The crystal structure of a complex of the Lck SH2 domain with a high-affinity ligand, pY324, is known. This ligand has the sequence EPQpYEEIPIYL. RESULTS: We designed and synthesized a series of phosphopeptides with single amino-acid changes in the four residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) in pY324. Surprisingly, the Glu one residue C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (at position pY + 1) is sensitive to substitution, whereas the Ile at position pY + 3 is much less sensitive, accommodating a Glu with only modest loss of binding affinity. Replacement of the Glu and Pro on either side of the Ile had little effect, as predicted. Truncated phosphopeptides that end at position pY + 5 and have only an acetyl group N-terminal to the pTyr bound with only slightly lower affinity than pY324. In addition, naturally occurring phosphopeptide sequences that span a 1,000-fold range in binding affinity for the Lck SH2 domain have been identified. CONCLUSIONS: The Lck SH2 domain is highly selective for phosphotyrosyl-peptide binding; its specificity is dictated by the first and third residues C-terminal to the pTyr.

Using our established automated method, we identified more than 10,000 phosphopeptides from 200 \u00b5g of HCT116 cell lysate without fractionation with >85% phosphopeptide specificities. Compared with titania-based Spin Tip products, the automated IMCStips-based method gave 50% higher phosphopeptide identifications. The method reproducibility was further assessed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to show >50% phosphopeptide recoveries after the automated phosphopeptide extraction with coefficients of variation (CVs) of <20% over a 3-week period. The established automated method is a step toward standardization of the sample preparation of phosphopeptide samples and could be further expanded upon to create a fully automated \"cells to phosphopeptides\" method.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 115}, "docId": "31556780", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 115, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 284, "charStart": 117}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 461, "charStart": 286}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 602, "charStart": 463}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 853, "charStart": 604}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 978, "charStart": 855}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1161, "charStart": 980}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1292, "charStart": 1163}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1533, "charStart": 1294}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1749, "charStart": 1535}]}

Direct interaction of the SH2 domain of STAT4 with a phosphotyrosine residue in the IL-12 receptor has been proposed to be required for the subsequent STAT4 phosphorylation. The IL-12 receptor beta2 subunit contains three tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain. To test the hypothesis that one of these tyrosines is involved in binding STAT4, phosphopeptides were synthesized according to the amino acid sequences surrounding each of these tyrosine residues. Only the phosphopeptide containing pTyr800 strongly bound to STAT4 in a cell-free binding assay.

A series of alanine replacements was performed in this phosphopeptide to elucidate which amino acids surrounding the pTyr800 residue are critical for STAT4 binding. To summarize, the site on the IL-12 receptor which binds STAT4 can be described as -T-X-X-G-pY(800)-L-, where the core G-pY(800)-L motif is critical for the binding; the threonine at the pY-4 position has only a minor contribution and X represents amino acids not critical for the binding.

We have examined the phosphorylation of a 50,000-dalton cellular polypeptide associated with the Rous sarcoma virus (FSV) transforming protein pp60-src. It has been shown that pp60src forms a complex with two cellular polypeptides, an 89,000-dalton heat-shock protein (89K) and a 50,000-dalton phosphoprotein (50K). The pp60src-associated protein kinase activity phosphorylates at tyrosine residues, and the 50K polypeptide present in the complex contains phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. These observations suggest that the 50K polypeptide may be a substrate for the protein kinase activity of pp60src. To examine this possibility, we isolated the 50K polypeptide by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from lysates of uninfected or virally infected cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis indicated that the 50K polypeptide isolated by this method was the same polypeptide as that complexed to pp60src. In uninfected cells or cells infected by a transformation-defective mutant, the 50K polypeptide contained phosphoserine but little or no phosphotyrosine. In cells infected by Schmidt-Ruppin or Prague RSV, there was a 40- to 50-fold increase in the quantity of phosphotyrosine in the 50K protein. Thus, the phosphorylation of the 50K polypeptide at tyrosine is dependent on the presence of pp60src. However, the 50K polypeptide isolated from cells infected by temperature-sensitive mutants of RSV was found to be phosphorylated at tyrosine at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures; this behavior is different from that of other substrates or putative substrates of the pp60src kinase activity.

Recent studies have suggested that MKPs play an important role not only in the development of cancers, but also in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Thus, understanding the roles of MKPs in the development of cancer and their impact on chemotherapy can be exploited for therapeutic benefits for the treatment of human cancer.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 70, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 435, "charStart": 72}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 600, "charStart": 437}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 696, "charStart": 602}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 857, "charStart": 698}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1034, "charStart": 859}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1", "Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6", "Humans", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases", "Neoplasms"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}

How adaptor or scaffold proteins assemble signaling complexes through both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues to regulate specific signaling pathways and biological responses is unclear. We show in multiple cell types that endogenous 14-3-3zeta is phosphorylated on Tyr(179) in response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

The assembly of these 14-3-3:Shc scaffolds is specifically required for the recruitment of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling complex and the regulation of CTL-EN cell survival in response to cytokine. The biological significance of these findings was further demonstrated using primary bone marrow-derived mast cells from 14-3-3zeta(-/-) mice.

The phosphorylation characteristics of insulin receptor from control and insulin-treated rat H-35 hepatoma cells 32P-labeled to equilibrium have been documented. The 32P-labeled insulin receptor is isolated by immunoprecipitation with patient-derived insulin receptor antibodies in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors to preserve the native phosphorylation and structural characteristics of the receptor. The unstimulated insulin receptor contains predominantly [32P] phosphoserine and trace amounts of [32P]phosphothreonine in its beta subunit. In response to insulin, the insulin receptor beta subunit exhibits marked tyrosine phosphorylation and a 2-fold increase in total [32P]phosphoserine contents. High pressure liquid chromatography of the tryptic hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled receptor beta subunit from quiescent cells results in the resolution of up to 9 fractions containing [32P]phosphoserine. The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is concentrated in two of these receptor phosphopeptide fractions, whereas the increase in [32P]phosphoserine content is scattered in low abundance over all receptor tryptic fractions. Insulin receptors affinity-purified by lectin- and insulin-agarose chromatographies from insulin-treated, 32P-labeled cells exhibit a 22-fold increase in the Vmax of receptor tyrosine kinase activity toward histone when compared to controls. The elevated kinase activity of the insulin receptor derived from insulin-treated cells is not due to the presence of hormone bound to the receptor because the receptor kinase activity is assayed while immobilized on insulin-agarose. Furthermore, the insulin-activated receptor kinase activity is reversed following dephosphorylation of the receptor beta subunit with alkaline phosphatase in vitro. The correlation between the insulin-stimulated site specific tyrosine phosphorylation on receptor beta subunit and the elevation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity strongly suggests that the insulin receptor kinase is activated by hormone-stimulated autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues in intact cells, as previously demonstrated for the purified receptor.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 288, "charStart": 128}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 547, "charStart": 290}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 688, "charStart": 549}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 847, "charStart": 690}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1051, "charStart": 849}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1284, "charStart": 1053}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1526, "charStart": 1286}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1760, "charStart": 1528}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1925, "charStart": 1762}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2289, "charStart": 1927}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Enzyme Activation", "Kinetics", "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental", "Macromolecular Substances", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Rats", "Receptor, Insulin", "Trypsin", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a negative regulator of multiple signal transduction pathways. We observed that SHP-1 effectively antagonized Src-dependent phosphorylations in HEK293 cells. This occurred by dephosphorylation of Src substrates, because Src activity was unaffected in the presence of SHP-1. One reason for efficient dephosphorylation was activation of SHP-1 by Src. Recombinant SHP-1 had elevated activity subsequent to phosphorylation by Src in vitro, and SHP-1 variants with mutated phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, SHP-1 Y538F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F were less active toward Src-generated phosphoproteins in intact cells. A second reason for efficient dephosphorylation is the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. Pull-down experiments with different GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins revealed efficient interaction of Src-generated phosphoproteins with the SHP-1 catalytic domain rather than with the SH2 domains. Phosphopeptides that correspond to good Src substrates were efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1 in vitro. Phosphorylated \"optimal Src substrate\" AEEEIpYGEFEA (where pY is phosphotyrosine) and a phosphopeptide corresponding to a recently identified Src phosphorylation site in p120 catenin, DDLDpY(296)GMMSD, were excellent SHP-1 substrates. Docking of these phosphopeptides into the catalytic domain of SHP-1 by molecular modeling was consistent with the biochemical data and explains the efficient interaction. Acidic residues N-terminal of the phosphotyrosine seem to be of major importance for efficient substrate interaction. Residues C-terminal of the phosphotyrosine probably contribute to the substrate selectivity of SHP-1.

At early infection time, ribosomal proteins S2, S3a and Sa are newly phosphorylated. At early and early-late times, three phosphorylated non-ribosomal proteins (v1, v2 and v3) are differently associated temporally to ribosomes. Analyses of proteins extracted from 40S subunits, 80S ribosomes and polysomes show that v1 and v2 are distributed differently among the different ribosomal populations.

PURPOSE: To determine whether tyrosine 116 of the HSV-1 alpha22 protein is involved in virulence and is a potential phosphorylation site. METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to revert the Y116C mutation in the alpha22 gene of the strain OD4 to wild type (C116Y), and the effect of virulence was tested by using a marker transfer-infection protocol in mice. Immunoblot analysis, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, and phosphotyrosine pulldown-immunoblot protocols were used to assess the OD4 alpha22 isoforms. RESULTS: Reversion of the Y116C mutation resulted in a significant increase in the severity of ocular disease compared with the OD4 virus alone. Reversion of the Y116C and a previously identified mutation (S34A) together did not alter the severity of virulence compared with either mutation alone. Immunoblot analysis revealed a loss or reduction in alpha22 isoforms in the OD4 virus compared with wild type (CJ394 virus). The OD4 virus had numerous alterations in the alpha22 tryptic phosphopeptide pattern, including loss of specific peptides and shifts in the position of several peptides. Phosphotyrosine pulldowns revealed a loss of one or more isoforms and shifts in the apparent size of others. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that Y116 is a determinant of peripheral virulence in mice and that mutations at S34 and Y116 affect virulence independently. The data also show that the S34 and Y116 mutations substantially alter phosphorylation of the alpha22 protein, that Y116 is a potential phosphorylation site, and that the alpha22 protein contains at least two phosphotyrosines.

Although the immunocytochemical staining was markedly heterogeneous, binding of both antibodies was significantly greater to B31 cells than to untransformed Rat 1 cells. Binding of 1G2 to phosphotyrosine residues was specific; it was entirely inhibited by adding excess phenylphosphate but was not affected by phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. The relationship between the amount of phosphorylated tyrosine measured by our FCM technique and total cellular phosphotyrosine measured by phosphoamino acid analysis was linear in vanadate-treated BALB/c 3T3 cells. Treatment of B31 cells for 48 h with herbimycin A, a benzenoid ansamycin antibiotic, to decrease the expression and tyrosine kinase activity of pp60v-src caused reductions of 42% in anti-pp60v-src and 58% in anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunofluorescence. DNA staining with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide showed no cell cycle specificity in the binding of either antibody. Herbimycin A also caused the transformed cell line to revert to the morphology, actin configuration, and growth behavior of untransformed cells; these changes were reversed within 12 h after removal of the drug.

Current offline enrichment approaches using TiO(2), Ti, and Fe immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) material in batch or microtip format are widely used, but they suffer from irreproducibility and compromised selectivity. To address these shortcomings, we revisited the merits of performing phosphopeptide enrichment in an HPLC column format. We found that Fe-IMAC columns enabled the selective, comprehensive, and reproducible enrichment of phosphopeptides out of complex lysates. Column enrichment did not suffer from bead-to-sample ratio issues and scaled linearly from 100 \u03bcg to 5 mg of digest. Direct measurements on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer identified >7500 unique phosphopeptides with 90% selectivity and good quantitative reproducibility (median cv of 15%). The number of unique phosphopeptides could be increased to more than 14,000 when the IMAC eluate was subjected to a subsequent hydrophilic strong anion exchange separation. Fe-IMAC columns outperformed Ti-IMAC and TiO(2) in batch or tip mode in terms of phosphopeptide identification and intensity. Permutation enrichments of flow-throughs showed that all materials largely bound the same phosphopeptide species, independent of physicochemical characteristics. However, binding capacity and elution efficiency did profoundly differ among the enrichment materials and formats. As a result, the often quoted orthogonality of the materials has to be called into question. Our results strongly suggest that insufficient capacity, inefficient elution, and the stochastic nature of data-dependent acquisition in mass spectrometry are the causes of the experimentally observed complementarity.

Recent advances in MS instrumentation and progresses in phosphopeptide enrichment, in conjunction with more powerful data analysis tools, have facilitated unbiased characterization of thousands of site-specific phosphorylation events. Combined with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture metabolic labeling, these techniques have made it possible to quantitatively evaluate phosphorylation changes in various physiological states in stable cell lines. However, quantitative phosphoproteomics in primary cells and tissues remains a major technical challenge due to the lack of adequate techniques for accurate quantification. Here, we describe an integrated strategy allowing for large scale quantitative profiling of phosphopeptides in complex biological mixtures. In this technique, the mixture of proteolytic peptides was subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using a titania affinity column, and the purified phosphopeptides were subsequently labeled with iTRAQ reagents. After further fractionation by strong-cation exchange, the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer, which collects CID and high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra sequentially for peptide identification and quantitation. We demonstrate that direct phosphopeptide enrichment of protein digests by titania affinity chromatography substantially improves the efficiency and reproducibility of phosphopeptide proteomic analysis and is compatible with downstream iTRAQ labeling. Conditions were optimized for HCD normalized collision energy to balance the overall peptide identification and quantitation using the relative abundances of iTRAQ reporter ions.

The validity of using elemental phosphorus standards to accurately and precisely quantify phosphopeptides by capillary HPLC (capHPLC) coupled to ICP-collison cell-MS is investigated in detail. Operating requirements to maintain stable (31)P sensitivity along the reversed-phase gradient are described. Specifically, the use of an optimum postcolumn makeup flow with a defined acetonitrile content turned out to be necessary to buffer the acetonitrile variation of the capillary chromatographic eluent and ensure plasma stability. Then, a highly pure P-containing standard (bis(4-nitro-phenyl) phosphate, BNPP) was spiked into the samples and used to quantify them with very low absolute errors (2-4%) and excellent precision (3-6%). The capHPLC-ICPMS method showed excellent linearity over 3 orders of magnitude and provided adequate detection limits (110 fmol, 3.4 pg P). Accurate quantification of the phosphopeptides present in a tryptic digest of beta-casein and casein from bovine milk was then attempted. Previously, and in order to be able to close mass balances, total P contents, percentages of inorganic P present, and recoveries from the reversed-phase column used in the separation were computed for each sample. Quantification using the spiked BNPP for the different phosphopeptides detected matched the expected values well validating the quantitative methodology proposed. The capHPLC-ESIMS analysis allowed elucidating amino acid sequences, a requisite still necessary to translate the determined amount of P in each chromatographic peak into amount of phosphopeptide. The great potential of these strategies, based on ICPMS detection, to assess the many procedures proposed and commonly used for purification, preconcentration, and/or isolation of phosphopeptides in phosphoproteomics studies is demonstrated using a commercially available titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) cartridge for phosphopeptide enrichment from complex mixtures.

Glandular kallikrein cleaves in three places at the C terminus, liberating three small peptides, only one of which contains a phosphorylatable residue.

Protein kinase A phosphorylation of purified prolactin resulted in the production of only phosphoserine and primarily the most abundant (monophosphorylated) variant. We conclude that serine 177 is the major in vivo phosphorylation site of rat prolactin and that phosphorylation of this site can be reproduced by protein kinase A in vitro.

We show that replacing the MS(3) precursor (parent) ion mass by a highly accurate MS(2) precursor (grandparent) mass increases the number of identified phosphopeptides 3- to 5-fold. The number of unique phosphopeptides identified in addition to the MS(2) data increases from 6% to 24%. Our results illustrate that the sensitivity of phosphopeptide identification depends critically on the mass tolerance setting applied in the database search. This study demonstrates that MS(3) parent ion masses should always be substituted by high-accuracy grandparent ion masses and that error tolerance settings should be set as low as instrument accuracy permits to yield the best possible identification sensitivity.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 90, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 283, "charStart": 92}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 465, "charStart": 285}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 569, "charStart": 467}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 727, "charStart": 571}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 990, "charStart": 729}], "mesh": ["Mass Spectrometry", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Proteomics", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "type": ["Letter", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The development of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has made it possible to characterize phosphopeptides in an increasingly large-scale and high-throughput fashion. However, extracting confident phosphopeptide identifications from the resulting large data sets in a similar high-throughput fashion remains difficult, as does rigorously estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of a set of phosphopeptide identifications. This article describes a data analysis pipeline designed to address these issues. The first step is to reanalyze phosphopeptide identifications that contain ambiguous assignments for the incorporated phosphate(s) to determine the most likely arrangement of the phosphate(s). The next step is to employ an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of the peptide scores. A linear discriminant analysis is then performed to determine how to optimally combine peptide scores (in this case, from SEQUEST) into a discriminant score that possesses the maximum discriminating power. Based on this discriminant score, the p- and q-values for each phosphopeptide identification are calculated, and the phosphopeptide identification FDR is then estimated. This data analysis approach was applied to data from a study of irradiated human skin fibroblasts to provide a robust estimate of FDR for phosphopeptides.

In this study, protein phosphorylation of the cytadherence-accessory proteins HMW1, HMW2, and HMW4 of M. pneumoniae was examined using biochemical and immunological techniques. The initial indication of protein modification came from Western immunoblot analysis of the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) profile of M. pneumoniae proteins, revealing multiple spots for both HMW1 and HMW4 that varied in pI but not in size. M. pneumoniae cultured in the presence of H3(32)PO4 exhibited numerous phosphorylated proteins as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE and autoradiography. These included proteins corresponding to HMW1, HMW2, and HMW4 in electrophoretic mobility. The Triton X-100 partitioning characteristics of these phosphorylated proteins was identical to that described previously for HMW1, -2, and -4. Furthermore, these protein bands were absent when a noncytadhering variant deficient in HMW1-5 was examined in the same manner. Finally, the availability of antiserum to HMW1 and -4 enabled us to confirm by radioimmunoprecipitation that HMW1 and HMW4 are phosphoproteins. Phosphoamino acid analysis of acid-hydrolyzed HMW1 and HMW2 identified primarily phosphothreonine and, to a lesser extent, phosphoserine in HMW1 and predominantly phosphoserine, with a trace of phosphothreonine, in HMW2.

While affinity reagents are valuable tools for monitoring protein phosphorylation and studying signaling events in cells, generating them through immunization of animals with phosphopeptides is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. An attractive alternative is to use protein evolution techniques and isolate new anti-phosphopeptide binding specificities from a library of variants of a phosphopeptide-binding domain. To explore this strategy, we attempted to display on the surface of bacteriophage M13 the N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA1) domain of yeast Rad53p, which is a naturally occurring phosphothreonine (pT)-binding domain, and found it to be nonfunctional due to misfolding in the bacterial periplasm. To overcome this limitation, we constructed a library of FHA1 variants by mutagenic PCR and isolated functional variants after three rounds of affinity selection with its pT peptide ligand. A hydrophobic residue at position 34 in the \u03b21 strand was discovered to be essential for phage display of a functional FHA1 domain. Additionally, by heating the phage library to 50\u00b0C prior to affinity selection with its cognate pT peptide, we identified a variant (G2) that was ~8\u00b0C more thermally stable than the wild-type domain. Using G2 as a scaffold, we constructed phage-displayed libraries of FHA1 variants and affinity selected for variants that bound selectively to five pT peptides. These reagents are renewable and have high protein yields (~20-25mg/L), when expressed in Escherichia coli.

Cellular organization and response to internal and external stimuli are mediated by an intricate web of protein interactions. Some of these interactions are regulated by covalent posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. These modifications can change the chemical nature of the interaction interfaces and modulate the binding affinity of the interacting partners. In signal transduction, the most frequent modification is reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine or threonine residues. Protein phosphorylation may modulate the activity of enzymes by modifying their conformation, or regulate the formation of complexes by creating docking sites to recruit downstream effectors. Families of modular domains, such as SH2, PTB, and 14-3-3, act as \"readers\" of the modification event. Specificity between closely related domains of the same family is mediated by the chemical properties of the domain binding surface that, aside from offering a hydrophilic pocket for the phosphorylated residue, shows preference for specific sequences. Although the protein structure and the cell context are also important to ensure specificity, the amino acid sequence flanking the phosphorylation site defines the accuracy of the recognition process, and it is therefore essential to define the binding specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains in order to understand and to infer the interaction web mediated by phosphopeptides. Methods commonly used to discover new interactions (such as yeast two hybrid and phage display) are not suited to study interactions with phosphorylated proteins.

{"text": "Tailor-Made Detection of Individual Phosphorylated and Non-Phosphorylated EPIYA-Motifs of Helicobacter pylori Oncoprotein CagA. The gastric pathogen and carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) encodes a type IV secretion system for translocation of the effector protein CagA into host cells. Injected CagA becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at the five amino acid residue Glutamate-Proline- Isoleucine-Tyrosine-Alanine (EPIYA)-sequence motifs. These phosphorylated EPIYA-sites represent recognition motifs for binding of multiple host factors, which then manipulate signaling pathways to trigger gastric disease. Thus, efficient detection of single phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs in CagA is required. Detection of phospho-CagA is primarily performed using commercial pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies. However, those antibodies were originally generated to recognize many phosphotyrosines in various mammalian proteins and are not optimized for use in bacteria. To address this important limitation, we synthesized 11-mer phospho- and non-phospho-peptides from EPIYA-motifs A, B, and C, and produced three phospho-specific and three non-phospho-specific rabbit polyclonal CagA antibodies. These antibodies specifically recognized the corresponding phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs, while the EPIYA-C antibodies also recognized the related East-Asian EPIYA-D motif. Otherwise, no cross-reactivity of the antibodies among EPIYAs was observed. Western blotting demonstrated that each EPIYA-motif can be predominantly phosphorylated during H. pylori infection.

The present study demonstrates that bovine milk osteopontin is phosphorylated at 27 serine residues and 1 threonine residue. Phosphoamino acids were identified by a combination of amino acid analysis, sequence analysis of S-ethylcysteine-derivatized phosphopeptides, and mass spectrometric analysis. Twenty-five phosphoserines and one phosphothreonine were located in Ser/Thr-X-Glu/Ser(P)/Asp motifs, and two phosphoserines were found in the sequence Ser-X-X-Glu/Ser(P). These sequence motifs are identical with the recognition sequences of mammary gland casein kinase and casein kinase II, respectively. Examination of the phosphorylation pattern revealed that the phosphorylations were clustered in groups of approximately three spanned by unphosphorylated regions of 11-32 amino acids. This pattern is probably of importance in the multiple functions of OPN involving interaction with Ca2+ and inorganic calcium salts. Furthermore, three O-glycosylated threonines (Thr 115, Thr 124, and Thr 129) have been identified in a threonine- and proline-rich region of the protein.

Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are mostly found in multicellular organisms where they recognize phosphotyrosine-containing signaling proteins. Spt6, a conserved transcription factor and putative histone chaperone, contains a C-terminal SH2 domain conserved from yeast to human. In mammals, this SH2 domain recognizes phosphoserines rather than phosphotyrosines and is essential for the recruitment of Spt6 by elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), enabling Spt6 to participate in the coupling of transcription elongation, chromatin modulation, and mRNA export. We have determined the structure of the entire Spt6 C-terminal region from Antonospora locustae, revealing the presence of two highly conserved tandem SH2 domains rather than a single SH2 domain. Although the first SH2 domain has a canonical organization, the second SH2 domain is highly noncanonical and appears to be unique in the SH2 family. However, both SH2 domains have phosphate-binding determinants. Our biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that the complete tandem, but not the individual SH2 domains, are necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Spt6 with RNAPII and are important for Spt6 function in vivo. Furthermore, our data suggest that binding of RNAPII to the Spt6 tandem SH2 is more extensive than the mere recognition of a doubly phosphorylated C-terminal domain peptide by the tandem SH2. Taken together, our results show that Spt6 interaction with RNAPII via a novel arrangement of canonical and noncanonical SH2 domains is crucial for Spt6 function in vivo.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 92, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 233, "charStart": 94}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 368, "charStart": 235}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 651, "charStart": 370}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 847, "charStart": 653}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 996, "charStart": 849}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1059, "charStart": 998}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1280, "charStart": 1061}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1472, "charStart": 1282}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1643, "charStart": 1474}], "mesh": ["Fungal Proteins", "Humans", "Microsporidia", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "RNA Polymerase II", "Transcription Factors", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

In recent years, phosphorylated peptides have emerged as a group of tumour-associated antigens presented by MHC molecules and recognised by T cells, and represent promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. However, the impact of phosphorylation on the antigenic identity of phosphopeptide epitopes is unclear. Here we examined this by determining structures of MHC-bound phosphopeptides bearing canonical position 4-phosphorylations in the presence and absence of their phosphate moiety, and examining phosphopeptide recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR). Strikingly, two peptides exhibited major conformational changes upon phosphorylation, involving a similar molecular mechanism, which focussed changes on the central peptide region most critical for T cell recognition. In contrast, a third epitope displayed little conformational alteration upon phosphorylation. In addition, binding studies demonstrated TCR interaction with an MHC-bound phosphopeptide was both epitope-specific and absolutely dependent upon phosphorylation status. These results highlight the critical influence of phosphorylation on the antigenic identity of naturally processed class I MHC epitopes.

Reversible phosphorylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications of proteins and a key regulator of cellular signaling pathways. Specific enrichment of phosphopeptides from proteolytic digests is a prerequisite for large scale identification of protein phosphorylation by mass spectrometry. Online enrichment of phosphopeptides attracts particular interests due to its automated operation, higher throughput and reproducibility, lower sample loss, and contamination. Here, we report a new type of capillary column developed using surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) for automated online phosphopeptide enrichment. SI-ATRP modification leads to a surface confined growth of three-dimensional wavelike polymer structure on the inner wall of capillary columns and, therefore, results in largely increased surface area. Furthermore, the noncross-linked flexible polymer chains grown by SI-ATRP create a large internal volume that allows phosphopeptides to penetrate into during enrichment and also facilitate the interaction between the numerous functional groups in the polymer chains and target phosphopeptides. Therefore, highly efficient and specific enrichment is achieved even for a low femtomole of phosphopeptides. The loading capacity is increased more than an order of magnitude compared with that obtained using conventional open tubular capillary columns. The SI-ATRP modified capillary column was successful applied in the online phosphoproteomics analysis of HepG2 cell lysate and resulted in 10 times improved phosphopeptide identification than the previously reported number.

The binding of tyrosine phosphorylated targets by SH2 domains is required for propagation of many cellular signals in higher eukaryotes; however, the determinants of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition by SH2 domains are not well understood. In order to identify the attributes of pTyr required for high affinity interaction with SH2 domains, the binding of the SH2 domain of the Src kinase (Src SH2 domain) to a dephosphorylated peptide, a phosphoserine-containing peptide, and the amino acid pTyr was studied using titration calorimetry and compared with the binding of a high affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide. The dephosphorylated peptide and the phosphoserine containing peptide both bind extremely weakly to the Src SH2 domain (DeltaGo (dephosphorylated)=-3.6 kcal/mol, DeltaGo (phosphoserine) >-3.7 kcal/mol); however, the DeltaGo value of pTyr binding is more favorable (-4.7 kcal/mol, or 50 % of the entire binding free energy of a high affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide). These results indicate that both the phosphate and the tyrosine ring of the pTyr are critical determinants of high affinity binding. Alanine mutagenesis was also used to evaluate the energetic contribution to binding of ten residues located in the pTyr-binding site. Mutation of the strictly conserved Arg betaB5 resulted in a large increase in DeltaGo (DeltaDeltaGo=3.2 kcal/mol) while elimination of the other examined residues each resulted in a significantly smaller (DeltaDeltaGo<1.4 kcal/mol) reduction in affinity, indicating that Arg betaB5 is the single most important determinant of pTyr recognition. However, mutation of Cys betaC3, a residue unique to the Src SH2 domain, surprisingly increased affinity by eightfold (DeltaDeltaGo=-1.1 kcal/mol). Using a double mutant cycle analysis, it was revealed that residues of the pTyr-binding pocket are not coupled to the peptide residues C-terminal to the pTyr. In addition, comparison of each residue's DeltaDeltaGo value upon mutation with that residue's sequence conservation among SH2 domains revealed only a modest correlation between a residue's energetic contribution to pTyr recognition and its conservation throughout evolution.

Increasing number of studies report the relevance of protein Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in bacterial physiology, yet the analysis of this type of modification in bacteria still presents a considerable challenge. Unlike in eukaryotes, where tens of thousands of phosphorylation events likely occupy more than two thirds of the proteome, the abundance of protein phosphorylation is much lower in bacteria. Even the state-of-the-art phosphopeptide enrichment protocols fail to remove the high background of abundant unmodified peptides, leading to low signal intensity and undersampling of phosphopeptide precursor ions in consecutive data-dependent MS runs. Consequently, large-scale bacterial phosphoproteomic datasets often suffer from poor reproducibility and a high number of missing values. Here we explore the application of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer in bacterial phosphoproteome analysis, focusing especially on run-to-run sampling reproducibility. In multiple measurements of identical phosphopeptide-enriched samples, we show that PRM outperforms data-dependent acquisition (DDA) in terms of detection frequency, reaching almost complete sampling efficiency, compared to 20% in DDA. We observe a similar trend over multiple heterogeneous phosphopeptide-enriched samples and conclude that PRM shows a great promise in bacterial phosphoproteomics analyses where reproducible detection and quantification of a relatively small set of phosphopeptides is desired. SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial phosphorylated peptides occur in low abundance compared to their unmodified counterparts, and are therefore rarely reproducibly detected in shotgun (DDA) proteomics measurements.

INTRODUCTIONWhether using a pressure cell or gel-loader tips, IMAC-purified peptides can be injected into a \u03bcLC separation system and analyzed by \u03bcLC-ESI-MS/MS. Phosphopeptides behave and elute similarly to nonphosphorylated peptides during RP-HPLC, but because of a decrease in hydrophobicity due to the addition of the phosphate moiety, a phosphopeptide will generally elute before the nonphosphopeptide with the identical amino acid sequence. This difference in elution time is most pronounced for short peptides. Thus, when analyzing phosphopeptides from \u03bcLC online with ESI-MS/MS, it is prudent to acquire data during the wash step (i.e., prior to gradient elution), as some short phosphopeptides may not even bind to the C(18) resin in 100% aqueous solutions.

Proteomics studies reveal changes in the secretory pathway. BACKGROUND: The secretion of heterologous animal proteins in filamentous fungi is usually limited by bottlenecks in the vesicle-mediated secretory pathway. RESULTS: Using the secretion of bovine chymosin in Aspergillus awamori as a model, we found a drastic increase (40 to 80-fold) in cells grown with casein or casein phosphopeptides (CPPs). CPPs are rich in phosphoserine, but phosphoserine itself did not increase the secretion of chymosin. The stimulatory effect is reduced about 50% using partially dephosphorylated casein and is not exerted by casamino acids. The phosphopeptides effect was not exerted at transcriptional level, but instead, it was clearly observed on the secretion of chymosin by immunodetection analysis. Proteomics studies revealed very interesting metabolic changes in response to phosphopeptides supplementation. The oxidative metabolism was reduced, since enzymes involved in fermentative processes were overrepresented. An oxygen-binding hemoglobin-like protein was overrepresented in the proteome following phosphopeptides addition. Most interestingly, the intracellular pre-protein enzymes, including pre-prochymosin, were depleted (most of them are underrepresented in the intracellular proteome after the addition of CPPs), whereas the extracellular mature form of several of these secretable proteins and cell-wall biosynthetic enzymes was greatly overrepresented in the secretome of phosphopeptides-supplemented cells. Another important 'moonlighting' protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which has been described to have vesicle fusogenic and cytoskeleton formation modulating activities, was clearly overrepresented in phosphopeptides-supplemented cells.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNk) in insulin resistance after burn and its mechanism. METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control, burn and burn + anisomycin groups. The rats in control group received sham burn trauma, and burn and burn + anisomycin groups received 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full thickness burn injury. Anisomycin (5 mg/kg) together with 250 microl dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was injected to the rats in anisomycin group intravenously, and only 250 microl DMSO in the other two groups. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps was performed 2 hours after the injection. The changes of phospho-serine 307, phospho-tyrosine of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and phospho-JNK in muscle tissues were determined and compared using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis or immunohistochemistry in the three groups. RESULTS: The infusing rates of total 10% glucose (mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) in control, burn and burn + anisomycin group were 12.3 +/- 0.4, 6.6 +/- 0.3, 6.5 +/- 0.4, respectively. The level of IRS-1 Serine 307 phosphorylation and phospho-JNK in muscle increased significantly, while insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreased markedly after burn.

Recent advances in phosphopeptide enrichment prior to mass spectrometric analysis show genuine promise for characterization of phosphoproteomes. Tandem mass spectrometry of phosphopeptide ions, using collision-activated dissociation (CAD), often produces product ions dominated by the neutral loss of phosphoric acid. Here we describe a novel method, termed Pseudo MS(n), for phosphopeptide ion dissociation in quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers. The method induces collisional activation of product ions, those resulting from neutral loss(es) of phosphoric acid, following activation of the precursor ion. Thus, the principal neutral loss product ions are converted into a variety of structurally informative species. Since product ions from both the original precursor activation and all subsequent neutral loss product activations are simultaneously stored, the method generates a \"composite\" spectrum containing fragments derived from multiple precursors. In comparison to analysis by conventional MS/MS (CAD), Pseudo MS(n) shows improved phosphopeptide ion dissociation for 7 out of 10 synthetic phosphopeptides, as judged by an automated search algorithm (TurboSEQUEST). A similar overall improvement was observed upon application of Pseudo MS(n) to peptides generated by enzymatic digestion of a single phosphoprotein. Finally, when applied to a complex phosphopeptide mixture, several phosphopeptides mis-assigned by TurboSEQUEST under the conventional CAD approach were successfully identified after analysis by Pseudo MS(n).", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 119, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 264, "charStart": 121}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 437, "charStart": 266}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 570, "charStart": 439}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 730, "charStart": 572}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 842, "charStart": 732}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1083, "charStart": 844}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1300, "charStart": 1085}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1449, "charStart": 1302}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1658, "charStart": 1451}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Mass Spectrometry", "Phosphopeptides", "Protons", "Sequence Analysis, Protein"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Characterization of two membrane-bound pp15 protein tyrosine phosphatases from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was shown previously that 422 (aP2) protein, a 15-kDa fatty acid binding protein, is phosphorylated on Tyr19 both in vitro by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and in intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin and phenylarsine oxide (PAO). Phospho-422(aP2) protein (pp15) accumulates in cells treated with insulin and PAO because the arsenical blocks turnover of the phosphoryl group of pp15. These findings suggest that a PAO-sensitive enzyme mediates turnover of the pp15 tyrosine phosphoryl group. We have purified and characterized two membrane protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that catalyze hydrolysis of phospho-Tyr19 of authentic pp15. These enzymes, designated PTPases HA1 and HA2, were purified approximately 20,000-fold and approximately 15,000-fold, respectively, and shown to differ markedly in their sensitivity to both vanadate and phosphotyrosine. Both enzymes are inhibited by PAO and accordingly can be labeled with 4-[125I]iodo-PAO. By this method, it was demonstrated that PTPases HA1 and HA2 have molecular masses of approximately 60 kDa and approximately 38 kDa, respectively.

The kinetics of phosphorylation in vivo were determined by probing western blots with this antibody. Within 1 h following a switch from extended darkness to high light (200 [mu]mol photons m-2 s-1), the 88-kD protein was detectable upon India ink staining of western blots. After 3 h, the antibody recognized the phosphorylated form of this polypeptide. Within 6 h of a downshift from high to low light, the 88-kD protein was dephosphorylated.

We have developed a novel approach to enhance phosphopeptide identification in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based phosphoproteomics. After enrichment of phosphopeptides with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) microcolumns, samples were coinjected with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) into LC/MS. This procedure decreased the MS peak intensity of nonphosphorylated peptides, but not that of phosphopeptides, and as a result, the number of identified phosphopeptides was increased.

Although the mechanism of the positive effect of EDTA on identification of phosphopeptides is unknown, and we have never observed metal ion adduct peaks in LC/MS spectra, coinjection of EDTA seemed to enhance phosphopeptide recovery from the LC/MS system. This simple technique was successfully applied to the identification of phosphopeptides in mouse brain (2938 phosphopeptides), human plasma (127 phosphopetides), and human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (123 phosphopeptides). We also identified nonphosphopeptides in the same samples using a two-dimensional (2D) LC/MS-based shotgun approach.

As one of the most studied post-translational modifications (PTM), protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in almost all cellular processes. Current methods are able to predict and determine thousands of phosphorylation sites, whereas stoichiometric quantification of these sites is still challenging. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based targeted proteomics is emerging as a promising technique for site-specific quantification of protein phosphorylation using proteolytic peptides as surrogates of proteins. However, several issues may limit its application, one of which relates to the phosphopeptides with different phosphorylation sites and the same mass (i.e., isobaric phosphopeptides). While employment of site-specific product ions allows for these isobaric phosphopeptides to be distinguished and quantified, site-specific product ions are often absent or weak in tandem mass spectra. In this study, linear algebra algorithms were employed as an add-on to targeted proteomics to retrieve information on individual phosphopeptides from their common spectra. To achieve this simultaneous quantification, a LC-MS/MS-based targeted proteomics assay was first developed and validated for each phosphopeptide. Given the slope and intercept of calibration curves of phosphopeptides in each transition, linear algebraic equations were developed. Using a series of mock mixtures prepared with varying concentrations of each phosphopeptide, the reliability of the approach to quantify isobaric phosphopeptides containing multiple phosphorylation sites (\u2265 2) was discussed.

In this study, chlorophosphonazo type derivatives of chromotropic acid including p-hydroxychlorophosphonazo (HCPA) and chlorophosphonazo I (CPA I), traditionally used in the photometric determination of transition metal ions, have been employed as chelating ligands in the preparation of novel affinity materials for phosphopeptide enrichment.

However, cyclic phosphopeptide synthesis may not be straightforward due to the sterically hindered phosphorylated side-chain amino acid derivatives. One option to overcome this hurdle is to use microwave-assisted synthesis, which has been shown to increase efficiency and reduce synthesis time.

Are there readily applicable protocols suitable for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry-based phosphopeptide stability estimations? There have been many successful efforts to enrich phosphopeptides in complex protein mixtures by the use of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and/or metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) with which mass spectrometric analysis of phosphopeptides has become state of the art in specialized laboratories, mostly applying nanoLC electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based investigations. However, widespread use of these powerful techniques is still not achieved. In this study, we present a ready-to-use phosphopeptide enrichment procedure using commercially available TiO(2)-loaded pipette tips in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analyses. Using \u03b1-casein as a model protein and citric acid as additive during sample loading, a similar enrichment success can be achieved as compared to applying 2,5- dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) for this task. But the DHB-inherited drawbacks are eliminated. In addition, we show that combining DHB and 2,4,6-trihydroxy acetophenone (THAP) as matrix for MALDI-MS measurements retains the sensitivity of DHB for phosphopeptide analysis but adds the homogenous crystallization properties of THAP, enabling preparation of evenly distributed matrix surfaces on MALDI-MS anchor targets, a prerequisite for automated MALDI- MS analyses. Tripartite motif-containing protein 28 and stathmin are two examples for which successful phosphopeptide enrichment of either sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-separated proteins is shown. Finally, high resolution MALDI Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry after phosphopeptide enrichment suggests that chemical dephosphorylation may occur as a side reaction during basic elution of phosphopeptides bound to MOAC surfaces, suggesting that proteome-wide phosphopeptide analyses ought to be interpreted with caution.

These results suggest that 1) neurons exist physiologically in different states of phosphorylation, ranging from a state of very high phosphorylation (e.g., in the cerebral cortex) to a state of very low phosphorylation (e.g., in many thalamic nuclei); 2) the fraction of highly phosphorylated neurons in cerebral cortex is higher in waking than in sleep and 3) part of the immunoreactive phosphorylation present in highly labeled cortical neurons is controlled by the locus coeruleus.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 143, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 270, "charStart": 145}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 576, "charStart": 272}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 722, "charStart": 578}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 927, "charStart": 724}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1114, "charStart": 929}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1404, "charStart": 1116}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1596, "charStart": 1406}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 2082, "charStart": 1598}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Cerebral Cortex", "Circadian Rhythm", "Gene Expression", "Hippocampus", "Hypothalamus", "Locus Coeruleus", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Neurons", "Oxidopamine", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Phosphothreonine", "Polysomnography", "Proteins", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred WKY", "Receptors, Adrenergic", "Sleep", "Sleep Deprivation", "Thalamus"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The protein p56lck (Lck) is a Src-like, lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase. A phosphopeptide library screen has recently been used to deduce an 'optimal' binding sequence for the Lck SH2 domain.

An 11-residue phosphopeptide derived from the hamster polyoma middle-T antigen, EPQpYEEIPIYL, binds with an approximately 1 nM dissociation constant to the Lck SH2 (ref. 17), an affinity equivalent to that of the tightest known SH2-phosphopeptide complex.

This study seeks to gain deep insight into a pivotal role of Cdc14 in the signaling network of B. bassiana by analyzing the Cdc14-specific proteome and phosphoproteome generated by the 8-plex iTRAQ labeling and MS/MS analysis of peptides and phosphopeptides.

At pH 2.6 or lower, tryptic phosphopeptides are not retained during the first-dimension SCX chromatography step. Thus the capture of these peptides in the flow-through by the second-dimension RP trap can dramatically reduce the complexity of the phosphopeptide chromatography, resulting in little or no suppression of the signal often caused by the coeluting nonphosphorylated peptides. The method provides higher phosphopeptide recovery and less nonspecific biding of acidic peptides than the commonly used enrichment methods, such as immobilized metal affinity chromatography.

Although the combination of MS3 analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is helpful to identify phosphopeptides, the quality of many MS/MS spectra having a neutral loss peak of phosphate is still too poor to allow sequence identification, and this results in many false-negative as well as false-positive identifications.

Phosphorylation has been the most studied of all the posttranslational modifications of proteins. Mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool for phosphomapping on proteins/peptides. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of phosphopeptides leads to the loss of phosphoric or metaphosphoric acid as a neutral molecule, giving an intense neutral loss product ion in the mass spectrum. Dissociation of the neutral loss product ion identifies peptide sequence. This method of data-dependent constant neutral loss (DDNL) scanning analysis has been commonly used for mapping phosphopeptides.

It is the first database that provides a systematic resource for the query of phosphosites on peptides and their corresponding masses. This allows researchers to search certain proteins of which phosphosites have been reported, to browse detailed phosphopeptide and fragment information, to match masses from MS analyses with defined threshold to the corresponding phosphopeptide, and to compare proprietary phosphopeptide discovery results with results from previous studies. Additionally, a database search software is created and a \"two-stage search strategy\" is suggested to identify phosphopeptides from tandem mass spectra of proteomics data. We expect PhoPepMass to be a useful tool and a source of reference for proteomics researchers.

A comparison of phosphotyrosine peptides enriched by immuno-affinity precipitation and metal-based affinity chromatography. Analysis of tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics remains challenging, due to the low occurrence of this post-translational modification compared to serine and threonine phosphorylation events in mammalian systems. Conventional metal-based affinity chromatography methods used to enrich phosphopeptides can nowadays isolate over 10,000 phosphopeptides. However, these approaches are not particularly suitable for the selective enrichment of low abundant Tyr phosphorylated peptides as the higher abundant co-enriched serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) phosphorylated peptides typically obscure their detection. Therefore, a more targeted approach based on immuno-affinity precipitation at the peptide level has been introduced for the specific analysis of Tyr phosphorylated species. This method typically leads to the detection of a few hundreds of phosphopeptides, albeit typically over 70% of those are Tyr phosphorylated. Here, we evaluated and compared phosphotyrosine peptides enriched by a phospho-Tyr immuno-affinity enrichment (employing pY99 antibodies) and a multidimensional approach consisting of metal-affinity based enrichment (Ti(4+)-IMAC) followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) fractionation.

The major protein substrates are a 73-kD protein and a protein migrating near ovalbumin on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 47-kD protein was partially purified from cells harvested by leukapheresis from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography.

Both the membrane kinase and casein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of about 1 mol of phosphate per mole of the band 3 fragment. The phosphorylation of the band 3 fragment by both kinases was not additive, suggesting that the two enzymes might recognize the same phosphorylation sites. Also in support of this notion was the observation that the phosphopeptide maps of the band 3 fragment phosphorylated by the two kinases were identical.

The secretin receptor belongs to a recently recognized family of G protein-coupled receptors that lack the sequence motifs typical of the beta-adrenergic receptor family. Because our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for these receptors is largely based on the latter group, we have begun to explore these mechanisms in the secretin receptor. In the present study, we focused on receptor phosphorylation, a key mechanism of receptor desensitization. Secretin receptor phosphorylation was demonstrated in intact transiently transfected COS cells and a stable receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary cell line in response to stimulation with native agonist. Secretin phosphoreceptor migrated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at M(r) 57,000-62,000 in its native state and at M(r) 42,000 after deglycosylation, similar to the receptor that had been affinity-labeled with 125I-[Tyr10,p-NO2-Phe22]-secretin-27. Phosphorylation occurred rapidly in a secretagogue concentration-dependent manner, with 0.1 microM secretin eliciting a 7.2-fold increase in phosphorylation after 2 min. One-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping after cyanogen bromide cleavage revealed a single band of M(r) 9400, corresponding in size to the carboxyl-terminal tail domain. This identification was confirmed with a truncation mutant in which potential sites of phosphorylation in the tail were eliminated and no agonist-stimulated phosphorylation was observed. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the secretin phosphoreceptor demonstrated predominance of phosphothreonine over phosphoserine (3.2:1), with no phosphotyrosine observed. Three distinct carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were constructed to each eliminate a subset of potential phosphorylation sites, and differential levels of phosphorylation were observed. Appropriate biosynthetic processing, expression on the cell surface, and signaling for each of these constructs were ensured by demonstration of ligand binding and cAMP responsiveness.

To better explore the overlap in ligand binding specificities exhibited by these two signaling regulators, we have mapped the phosphopeptide binding preferences of the SH2 domains from SOCS-3 and SHP-2. Degenerate phosphopeptide libraries were screened against recombinantly produced SH2 domains to determine the sequences of optimal phosphopeptide ligands. We found that the consensus ligand binding motif for SOCS-3 was pY-(S/A/V/Y/F)-hydrophobic-(V/I/L)-hydrophobic-(H/V/I/Y), while the consensus motif for SHP-2 was pY-(S/T/A/V/I)-X-(V/I/L)-X-(W/F).

In this study, the feasibility and general applicability of on-line IMAC/ESI/MS is investigated by using immobilized ferric ions for selective chelation of several phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine peptides. The sensitivity and practicality of the technique for phosphoproteins are demonstrated via the analysis of 30 pmol (\u223c0.7 \u03bcg) of bovine \u03b2-casein purified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and digested in situ with trypsin. It is observed that on-line IMAC/ESI/MS suffers less from sample losses than experiments performed off-line, suggesting that the limiting factors in sensitivity for this technique are the purification procedures and sample handling rather than the IMAC and mass spectrometry. Thus, the ability to inject the tryptic digest of an electroblotted protein directly onto the column without buffer exchange and to analyze the eluent directly via on-line coupling of the IMAC column to the mass spectrometer greatly reduces sample losses incurred through sample handling and provides a convenient method for analyzing phosphopeptides at low levels.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126}, "docId": "24227670", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 297, "charStart": 128}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 498, "charStart": 299}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 706, "charStart": 500}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1013, "charStart": 708}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1289, "charStart": 1015}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1655, "charStart": 1291}]}

The past decade has been marked by the emergence of selective affinity media and sensitive mass spectrometry instrumentation that facilitated large-scale phosphoproteome analyses and expanded the repertoire of protein phosphorylation. Despite these remarkable advances, the precise location of the phosphorylation site still represents a sizable challenge in view of the labile nature of the phosphoester bond and the presence of neighboring phosphorylatable residues within the same peptide. This difficulty is exacerbated by the combinatorial distribution of phosphorylated residues giving rise to different phosphopeptide isomers. These peptides have similar physicochemical properties, and their separation by LC is often problematic. Few studies have described the frequency and distribution of phosphoisomers in large-scale phosphoproteomics experiments, and no convenient informatics tools currently exist to facilitate their detection. To address this analytical challenge, we developed two algorithms to detect separated and co-eluting phosphopeptide isomers and target their subsequent identification using an inclusion list in LC-MS/MS experiments. Using these algorithms, we determined that the proportion of isomers present in phosphoproteomics studies from mouse, rat, and fly cell extracts represents 3-6% of all identified phosphopeptides. While conventional analysis can identify chromatographically separated phosphopeptides, targeted LC-MS/MS analyses using inclusion lists provided complementary identification and expanded the number of phosphopeptide isomers by at least 52%.

We now have examined the phosphorylation and activation of Ca2+/CaM kinase II in synaptosomes, a Ca2+-dependent neurosecretory system consisting of isolated nerve terminals. Synaptosomes were prelabeled with 32Pi and the alpha subunit of Ca2+/CaM kinase II was immunoprecipitated. Under basal incubation conditions the alpha subunit was phosphorylated. Depolarization of synaptosomes produced a rapid (2-5 s) Ca2+-dependent increase of about 50% in the state of phosphorylation of the alpha subunit. This was followed by a slower increase in the 32P content of the alpha subunit over the next 5 min of depolarization. The enhanced phosphorylation was characterized by an initial rise (2 s) and subsequent decrease (30 s) in the phosphothreonine content of the alpha subunit. In contrast, the phosphoserine content of the alpha subunit slowly increased during the course of depolarization. Thermolytic two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the alpha subunit demonstrated that depolarization stimulated the labeling of a phosphopeptide associated with autoactivation. In parallel experiments, unlabeled synaptosomes were depolarized, and lysates of these synaptosomes were assayed for Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. Depolarization produced a rapid (less than or equal to 2 s) increase in Ca2+-independent Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. This activity returned to basal levels by 60 s. Thus, depolarization of intact synaptosomes is associated with the transient phosphorylation of Ca2+/CaM kinase II on threonine residues, presumably involving an autophosphorylation mechanism and concomitantly the transient generation of the Ca2+-independent form of Ca2+/CaM kinase II.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 107, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 390, "charStart": 109}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 564, "charStart": 392}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 671, "charStart": 566}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 743, "charStart": 673}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 890, "charStart": 745}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1008, "charStart": 892}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1165, "charStart": 1010}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1279, "charStart": 1167}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1457, "charStart": 1281}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1603, "charStart": 1459}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1721, "charStart": 1605}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2056, "charStart": 1723}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Cerebral Cortex", "Enzyme Activation", "Kinetics", "Macromolecular Substances", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Synaptosomes"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Fer is ubiquitously expressed, and upregulation of Fer has been implicated in various human cancers. The PTK activity of Fes has been shown to be positively regulated by the binding of phosphotyrosine-containing ligands to the SH2 domain.

Recent studies have shown that the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, associates with the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 as it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during platelet aggregation: a process that can be mimicked in part by small synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 encompassing tyrosine residues Tyr-663 or Tyr-686. To further examine the molecular requirements for PECAM-1/SHP-2 interactions, we generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell lines that stably expressed mutant forms of PECAM-1 harboring tyrosine to phenylalanine (Tyr --> Phe) mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Y663F and Y686F forms of PECAM-1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated to a somewhat lesser extent than wild-type PECAM-1, and a doubly substituted Y663,686F form of PECAM-1 failed to become tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues 596, 636 and 701 do not serve as substrates for cellular kinases. Interestingly, SHP-2 binding was lost when either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 were changed to phenylalanine, indicating that both residues are required for SHP-2/PECAM-1 association. Although PECAM-1 phosphopeptides NSDVQpY663TEVQV and DTETVpY686SEVRK stimulated the catalytic activity of the phosphatase to a similar extent, surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that the Tyr-663-containing peptide had approximately 10-fold higher affinity for SHP-2 than did the Tyr-686 peptide. Finally, peptido-precipitation analysis showed that the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 reacted preferentially with the Tyr-663 PECAM-1 phosphopeptide, while the Tyr-686 phosphopeptide associated only with the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of the phosphatase.

The wild-type virus and deletion mutants (dl1263, dl1265, dl2194, and dl2198) were used for infection. On the basis of our results and published data (M. Schwyzer, R. Weil, and H. Zuber, J. Biol.

One phosphothreonine residue was located in the prolinerich C-terminal end of the molecule at position 701 or 708.

The iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind p110alpha but does not inhibit it. Inhibition of p110alpha requires the presence of the nSH2 domain linked to the iSH2 domain. Phosphopeptides increase the activity of nSH2/iSH2-p110alpha dimers, demonstrating that the nSH2 domain mediates both inhibition of p110alpha and disinhibition by phosphopeptides. In contrast, phosphopeptides did not increase the activity of iSH2/cSH2-p110alpha dimers, or dimers composed of p110alpha and an nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct containing a mutant nSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain increased p110alpha activity only in the context of an intact p85 containing both the nSH2 domain and residues 1-322 (the SH3, proline-rich and breakpoint cluster region-homolgy domains). These data suggest that the nSH2 domain of p85 is a direct regulator of p110alpha activity.

In this work, a binary matrix that consists of two conventional matrices of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA) and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) was tested for phosphopeptide analysis. 3-HPA and CCA were found to be hot matrices, and 3-HPA not as good as CCA and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) for peptide analysis.

One to two microliters of the unfractionated protein digest is infused at basic pH into an electrospray mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 20-40 nl/min using an ultra-low flow sprayer.

Alternative redox stimuli such as pervanadate or hypoxia/reoxygenation, induce transcription factor NF-\u03baB by phospho-tyrosine-dependent and proteasome-independent mechanisms. While considerable attention has been paid to the absence of proteasomal regulation of tyrosine phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1, there is a paucity of information regarding proteasomal regulation of signaling events distinct from tyrosine phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1. To delineate roles for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the phospho-tyrosine dependent mechanism of NF-\u03baB induction, we employed the proteasome inhibitor, Aclacinomycin, and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate (PV). Results from these studies demonstrate that phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (Tyr-42) is not subject to proteasomal degradation in a murine stromal epithelial cell line, confirming results previously reported.

Distinct effects of the neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and the mitogenic factor, epidermal growth factor. We recently characterized the association of the 44-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase, also known as extracellular-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), with the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90rsk), one of its putative substrates in intact PC12 cells. Using antibodies to ERK1 that precipitate a functional ERK1.pp90rsk phosphoprotein complex, we demonstrate here the regulation of both kinases by various stimuli. In mouse fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors, insulin and vanadate swiftly stimulated ERK1 activity within 5 min. While the hormonal effect was short-lived, vanadate led to a first peak followed by a progressively increasing second phase. In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor, which is a growth promoting factor, provokes a rapid but evanescent activation of ERK1. In contrast, nerve growth factor (NGF), which acts as a neuronal differentiation factor for PC12 cells, induced a swift monophasic response followed by a sustained second phase. This strikingly different pattern of ERK1 stimulation by NGF and epidermal growth factor was associated to a contrasting effect on ERK1 cellular translocation. Thus, NGF induced a nuclear translocation of ERK1, while epidermal growth factor was without noticeable effect on ERK1 localization. In both cell systems all effectors tested stimulated ERK1 phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in an 1:1 ratio. During ERK1 inactivation, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were dephosphorylated in a similar fashion. Concurrent with ERK1 activation was the de novo appearance of phosphothreonine and an increase in phosphoserine on pp90rsk. The pp90rsk phosphothreonine content paralleled the ERK1 activity more closely than the phosphoserine level. These results provide compelling evidence that in fibroblasts and PC12 cells ERK1 plays a direct role in the phosphorylation of pp90rsk and that pp90rsk represents a physiologically relevant substrate of extracellular-regulated kinases. Finally, we would like to suggest that the differentiating action of NGF in PC12 cells might be due, at least in part, to the conjunction of its sustained and robust stimulation of ERK1 and pp90rsk, and of its induction of ERK1 nuclear translocation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 144, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 261, "charStart": 146}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 506, "charStart": 263}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 669, "charStart": 508}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 794, "charStart": 671}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 919, "charStart": 796}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1047, "charStart": 921}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1225, "charStart": 1049}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1385, "charStart": 1227}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1518, "charStart": 1387}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1649, "charStart": 1520}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1756, "charStart": 1651}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1880, "charStart": 1758}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1989, "charStart": 1882}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2226, "charStart": 1991}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2477, "charStart": 2228}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Antibodies", "Autoradiography", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Homeostasis", "Insulin", "Kinetics", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Molecular Weight", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "PC12 Cells", "Phosphates", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases", "Vanadates"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

On stimulation of hematopoietic cells with interleukin 3 (IL-3), Shc becomes phosphorylated and may therefore contribute to IL-3 signaling. We investigated the interactions mediated by the Shc modular domains and pTyr sites in IL-3-dependent IC2 premast cells. The Shc PTB domain, rather than the SH2 domain, associated both in vitro and in vivo with the Tyr-phosphorylated beta subunit of the IL-3 receptor and with the SH2-containing 5' inositol phosphatase (SHIP), and it recognized specific NXXpY phosphopeptides from these binding partners. In IL-3-stimulated mast cells, Shc phosphorylation occurred primarily on Tyr239 and 317 and was dependent on a functional PTB domain. Phosphorylated Tyr317, and to a lesser extent, Tyr239, bound the Grb2 adaptor and SHIP. Furthermore, a pTyr317 Shc phosphopeptide selectively recognized Grb2, Sos1, SHIP, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase from mast cells, as characterized by mass spectrometry.

In addition to increasing the rate of PMA-dependent phosphorylation of the 68K protein in macrophages, LPS also promoted the phosphorylation of a novel peptide on the 68K protein. Thus while PMA stimulated the phosphorylation of two thermolytic phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 1 and 2), the low level of phosphorylation observed with LPS alone was found to occur on phosphopeptides 1 and 2 as well as on a novel phosphopeptide (phosphopeptide 3). Furthermore, LPS treatment of macrophages potentiated phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides when the cells were subsequently stimulated with PMA. While phosphorylation stimulated by LPS and PMA was slightly more than additive for phosphopeptides 1 and 2, it was markedly synergistic (increased 14.5-fold) for phosphopeptide 3. Phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides occurred exclusively on serine. It is possible that LPS-induced myristoylation of the 68K protein directs it to the membrane where its phosphorylation is enhanced by its close association with PKC.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 111, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 346, "charStart": 113}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 351, "charStart": 348}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 366, "charStart": 353}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 636, "charStart": 368}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 725, "charStart": 638}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 821, "charStart": 727}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1032, "charStart": 823}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1235, "charStart": 1034}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1415, "charStart": 1237}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1683, "charStart": 1417}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1836, "charStart": 1685}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2017, "charStart": 1838}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2094, "charStart": 2019}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2260, "charStart": 2096}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Female", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred ICR", "Molecular Weight", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C", "Substrate Specificity", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Plentiful studies have established a close association between aberrant phosphorylation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we applied a quantitative phosphoproteomics platform combining dimethylation labeling and online 3D strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX)-titanium oxide (TiO2)/RP-LTQ-Orbitrap to compare phosphoproteomes between three pairs of HCC tissues and non-tumor counterparts. This analysis yielded 7868 quantifiable phosphopeptides and numerous up- or down-regulated candidates. Increased phosphorylation of LMNA and NIPA was confirmed using specific antibodies. To expand our verification capability, we evaluated the use of LTQ-Orbitrap run in SIM/Accurate inclusion mass screening (AIMS) mode with a super-SILAC mixture as an internal standard to quantify a subset of phosphopeptide candidates in HCC tissue samples. In sample I used for discovery experiment, we successfully quantified 32 (in SIM mode) and 30 (in AIMS mode) phosphopeptides with median coefficients of variation (CVs) of 7.5% and 8.3%, respectively. When the assay was applied to other three pairs of HCC specimens for verification experiment, 40 target phosphopeptides were quantified reliably (~7.5% CV), and more than half of them were differentially expressed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Collectively, these results indicate the feasibility of using super-SILAC mix-SIM/AIMS assays for targeted verification of phosphopeptides discovered by large-scale phosphoproteome analyses of HCC specimens. In this study, we developed a strategy for conducting both discovery and targeted verification of deregulated phosphoproteins in HCC tissue specimens on LTQ-Orbitrap. This strategy allowed us to generate a quantitative HCC tissue phosphoproteome dataset containing significantly deregulated phosphoproteins that represents a valuable resource for the identification of potential HCC biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrated the feasibility of applying LTQ-Orbitrap, operated in SIM/AIMS mode, to multiplex and targeted verification of phosphopeptides in individual tissue specimens using a super-SILAC mix as an internal phosphopeptide standard.

An initial ion/ion reaction that employed multiply protonated amino-terminated dendrimers converted phosphopeptide anions to the doubly protonated species. The doubly charged cations were then subjected to ion/ion electron transfer to induce dissociation. Electron-transfer dissociation of doubly positively charged phosphopeptides yields characteristic c- and z-type fragment ions by dissociation of the N-C(alpha) bond along the peptide backbone while preserving the labile posttranslational modifications. These results illustrate the ability to alter ion charge after ion formation and prior to structural interrogation. Phosphopeptides provide an example where it can be difficult to form strong doubly charged cation signals directly when they are present in mixtures, which, as a result, precludes the use of electron-transfer dissociation as a structural probe.

Here, we studied the mechanism of this interaction in detail. Phosphopeptides representing the SHP-1 candidate binding sites in the Ros cytoplasmic domain, pY2267 and pY2327, display high affinity binding to the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain (Kd=217 nM and 171 nM, respectively). Y2327 is, however, a poor substrate of Ros kinase and, therefore, contributes little to SHP-1 binding in vitro. To explore the mechanism of association in intact cells, functional fluorescent fusion proteins of Ros and SHP-1 were generated. Complexes of both molecules could be detected by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in intact HEK293 and COS7 cells. As expected, the association required the functional SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain. Unexpectedly, pY2267 and pY2327 both contributed to the association.

Several members of the Src family, including Blk, Lyn, Fyn(T), and Lck, are expressed in B cells. These kinases associate with the antigen receptor complex, and the activities of Blk, Fyn(T), and Lyn increase upon receptor engagement. Differences in the amino acid sequences and patterns of expression of these kinases suggest that they serve distinct functions. In this communication it is shown that the SH2 domains from Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T) preferentially bind distinct sets of phosphoproteins from the mature B cell line A20. These interactions were found to depend on recognition of phosphotyrosine. The Blk SH2 domain bound more than 10 distinct phosphoprotein species, most of which reacted with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody; the phosphotyrosine content of these proteins was increased if surface immunoglobulin was cross-linked before extracts were made. Phosphoproteins of 72, 76, 115, and 130 kDa bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T). Phosphoamino acid analysis of these four proteins revealed that each contained phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Proteins of 90 kDa, 130 kDa, and 150 kDa were preferentially bound by the Blk SH2 domain, while the Fyn(T) SH2 domain showed preferential binding to proteins of 76 and 180 kDa. The Lyn SH2 binding profile resembled that of Blk, but differences in the binding specificities of these kinases were also observed. Thus, among proteins that exhibit increased tyrosine phosphorylation following antigen receptor cross-linking, several have been identified that bind preferentially to SH2 domains of Blk, Fyn(T), or Lyn, suggesting that these kinases serve distinct functions. In addition, chimeric Fyn(T)-Blk SH2 domains were shown to be functional in binding assays and to exhibit binding specificities intermediate between those of the parent domains, consistent with the interpretation that the differences we observe in phosphoprotein binding by Fyn(T) and Blk SH2 domains reflect differences in their native structures.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 121, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 219, "charStart": 123}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 356, "charStart": 221}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 484, "charStart": 358}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 651, "charStart": 486}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 726, "charStart": 653}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 987, "charStart": 728}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1081, "charStart": 989}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1214, "charStart": 1083}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1391, "charStart": 1216}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1524, "charStart": 1393}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1784, "charStart": 1526}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2133, "charStart": 1786}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Base Sequence", "Binding Sites", "DNA Primers", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Phosphoproteins", "Plasmids", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "src-Family Kinases"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Phosphorylation of the large and small isoforms of myelin-associated glycoprotein (L- and S-MAG) was investigated in primary oligodendrocyte cultures and in immortalized Schwann cells by incubating the cells with inorganic [32P]phosphate and immunoprecipitating MAG. In oligodendrocytes, both L- and S-MAG were phosphorylated, but L-MAG was much more heavily labeled. In Schwann cells, most of the phosphorylation was in S-MAG, which is the predominant isoform expressed by these cells. In both types of cells, the principal phosphorylated amino acid in MAG was serine. Radioactive phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were also detected in the MAG from oligodendrocytes. In Schwann cells, there was less phosphorylation of threonine and labeled phosphotyrosine was not detected. In both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, the phosphorylation of MAG was stimulated by phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore, but not by forskolin. The results indicate that the phosphorylation of MAG is catalyzed by protein kinase C and possibly other calcium-activated kinases in both types of myelinating cells, but not by cAMP-activated kinase. An inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase, ammonium vanadate, increased the amount of radioactive phosphate in MAG several fold in both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. However, even in the presence of vanadate, the great majority of radioactivity in MAG was in phosphoserine and only a small amount was in phosphotyrosine, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins may indirectly increase the phosphorylation of MAG.

Erbium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation from boiling phosphoric acid and incubated overnight in erbium chloride solutions. The resulting powder was embedded in a monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) polymer. The monolith was synthesized in a spin column by radical polymerization. Erbium phosphate demonstrated a high affinity and selectivity for phosphopeptides due to the strong interaction of trivalent erbium ions with the phosphate groups of phosphopeptides. The high selectivity and performance of the designed spin columns were demonstrated by successfully enriching phosphopeptides from tryptically digested protein mixtures containing the model phosphoproteins \u03b1- and \u03b2-casein, bovine milk, and human saliva. By the implementation of several washing steps, unspecific components were removed and the enriched phosphopeptides were effectively eluted from the spin columns under alkaline conditions.

The sequence of this protein kinase would predict that it is a protein serine/threonine kinase, which at first seemed incongruent with the cloning method. However, recent reports indicate that some protein kinases can phosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. To determine whether this protein kinase, which we call PYT (for phosphotyrosine picked threonine kinase), was a dual-specificity protein kinase we investigated its substrate specificity when expressed in bacteria. The catalytic domain was active as a protein kinase when expressed from any of several promoters and when expressed as a TrpE fusion protein. All experiments that resulted in an active protein kinase, as judged by incorporation of 32P by metabolic labeling, also resulted in the generation of proteins that were recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the metabolically labeled proteins that were recognized by the antibodies consistently yielded large amounts of phosphothreonine and only trace amounts of phosphotyrosine. We mapped the phosphorylation sites in the phosphorylated PYT protein and found only phosphothreonine; 90% of the radioactivity mapped to a threonine in the region autophosphorylated by many protein kinases. These data demonstrate that PYT is primarily a protein threonine kinase, but that it can phosphorylate tyrosine to a small extent, making it a potential dual-specificity protein kinase.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 131, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 345, "charStart": 133}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 500, "charStart": 347}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 622, "charStart": 502}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 837, "charStart": 624}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 979, "charStart": 839}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1196, "charStart": 981}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1398, "charStart": 1198}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1606, "charStart": 1400}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1792, "charStart": 1608}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Bacteria", "Base Sequence", "Histidine", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Substrate Specificity", "Threonine", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

A growing body of evidence has documented that Peptide-Plk1 inhibitors showed high Plk1 binding affinity. However, phosphopeptides-Plk1 inhibitors showed poor cell membranes permeability, which limits their clinical applications. In current study, nine candidate phosphopeptides consisting of non-natural amino acids were rationally designed and then successfully synthesized using an Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) strategy. Moreover, the binding affinities and selectivity were evaluated via fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The results confirmed that the most promising phosphopeptide 6 bound to Plk1 PBD with the IC50 of 38.99\u202fnM, which was approximately 600-fold selectivity over Plk3 PBD (IC50\u202f=\u202f25.44\u202f\u03bcM) and nearly no binding to Plk2 PBD. Furthermore the intracellular activities and the cell membrane permeability of phosphopeptide 6 were evalutated. Phosphopeptide 6 demonstrated appropriate cell membrane permeability and arrested HeLa cells cycle in G2/M phase by regulating CyclinB1-CDK1.

Kinetic correlation to autophosphorylation of specific sites in the beta subunit. The kinetics of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the beta subunit of the mouse insulin receptor and activation of receptor kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a model substrate were compared. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse proreceptor was determined to locate tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides. Receptor was first incubated with unlabeled ATP to occupy nonrelevant autophosphorylation sites, after which [32P]autophosphorylation at relevant sites and attendant activation of substrate phosphorylation were initiated with [gamma-32P]ATP and insulin. Activation of substrate phosphorylation underwent an initial lag of 10-20 s during which there was substantial 32P-autophosphorylation of tryptic phosphopeptides p2 and p3, but not p1. Following the lag, incorporation of 32P into p1 and the activation of substrate phosphorylation increased abruptly and exhibited identical kinetics. The addition of substrate to the receptor prior to ATP inhibits insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, and consequently substrate phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor in the presence of substrate inhibited primarily the incorporation of 32P into p1 and drastically inhibited substrate phosphorylation. From Edman radiosequencing of 32P-labeled p1, p2, and p3 and the amino acid sequence of the mouse receptor, the location of each phosphopeptide within the beta subunit was determined. Further characterization of these phosphopeptides revealed that p1 and p2 represent the triply and doubly phosphorylated forms, respectively, of the region within the tyrosine kinase domain containing tyrosines 1148, 1152, and 1153. The doubly phosphorylated forms contain phosphotyrosines either at positions 1148 and 1152/1153 or positions 1152 and 1153.

Reversible protein phosphorylation ranks among the most important post-translational modifications, and elucidation of phosphorylation sites is essential to understand the regulation of key cellular processes such as signal transduction. Enrichment of phosphorylated peptides is a prerequisite for successful analysis due to their low stoichiometry, heterogeneity, and low abundance. Enrichment is often performed manually, which is inherently labor-intensive and a major hindrance in large-scale analyses. Automation of the enrichment method would vastly improve reproducibility and thereby facilitate 'high-throughput' phosphoproteomics research. Here, we describe a robust and automated online TiO 2-based two-dimensional chromatographic approach to selectively enrich phosphorylated peptides from digests of complete cellular lysates. We demonstrate method enhancement for both adsorption and desorption of phosphorylated peptides resulting in lower limits of detection. Phosphorylated peptides from a mere 500 attomole tryptic digest of a protein mixture were easily detected. With the combination of strong cation exchange chromatography with the online TiO 2 enrichment, 2152 phosphopeptides were enriched from 250 microg of protein originating for the cell lysate of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. This is a 4-fold improvement when compared to an enrichment strategy based solely on strong cation exchange/LC-MS. Phosphopeptide enrichment methods are intrinsically biased against relatively basic phosphopeptides.

When phosphorylase b is incubated with the phosphorylated tetradecapeptide, the following changes occur: (1) the enzyme becomes partially catalytically active in the absence of AMP; (2) the allosteric interactions of the enzyme are altered, as evidenced by the fact that phosphorylase b does not bind AMP cooperatively, and is no longer inhibited by glucose-6-P; and (3) the enzyme, normally present as a dimer, associates to a tetramer. Phosphorylase b' is a modified form of phosphorylase in which the phosphorylation site has been removed by limited tryptic attack. In the presence of phosphopeptide, 86% of the total enzyme activity can be induced in the absence of AMP. The properties of phosphorylases b and b' with phosphopeptide, cited above, are all characteristics of the phosphonenzyme, phosphorylase a.

The phosphorylation site on a PEPC molecule is conserved not only among isoforms but also across plant species.

Large-scale phosphoproteomics studies are of great interest due to their potential for the dissection of signaling pathways controlled by protein kinases. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomic techniques offer new opportunities to profile protein kinase activities in a comprehensive manner. However, this increasingly used approach still poses many analytical challenges. On one hand, high stringency criteria for phosphopeptide identification based on MS/MS data are needed in order to avoid false positives; however, on the other hand, these stringent criteria also result in the introduction of many false negatives. In the current report, we employ different mass spectrometric techniques for large-scale phosphoproteomics in order to reduce the presence of false negatives and enhance data confidence. A LTQ-Orbitrap LC-MS/MS platform identified approximately 3 times more phosphopeptides than Q-TOF LC-MS/MS instrumentation (4308 versus 1485 identifications, respectively). In both cases, collision induced dissociation (CID) was used to fragment peptides. Interestingly, the two platforms produced complementary data as many of the low scoring phosphopeptide ions identified by LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS gave rise to high score identifications by Q-TOF MS/MS analysis, and vice versa. In fact, approximately 450 phosphopeptides identified by the Q-TOF instrument were not identified by the LTQ-Orbitrap. Further data comparison revealed the extent of the problem: in one experiment, the estimated number of false negatives (1066) was close to the number of identified phosphopeptides (1485). This work demonstrates that by using standard procedures for phosphopeptide identification the number of false negatives can be even greater than the number of false positives.

The rapidly growing field of phosphoproteomics has led to a strong demand for procedures enabling fast and reliable isolation and enrichment of phosphorylated proteins and peptides.

The ultimate goal of obtaining comprehensive phosphoproteomes has, however, been found difficult to achieve and the obtained results often vary, dependent on the enrichment method and protocol used. In the present study, the physical chemistry of the phosphopeptide binding to TiO(2) is investigated by means of measurements using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Special emphasis is put on the effect of the degree of phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide, the impact of the primary amino acid structure, and the role of electrostatic interactions. The results show that, in general, adsorption of phosphopeptides follows the Langmuir model and that the affinity for the TiO(2) surface increases in a nonlinear fashion with increasing degree of phosphorylation. An exception was detected, however, where positive cooperativity between the peptides existed and the Langmuir model no longer applied. The source behind the cooperativity could be traced back to the primary amino acid structure and, more specifically, the presence of positively charged amino acids in positions that enable electrostatic interaction with phosphoryl groups on neighboring peptides.

This work aims to develop analysis techniques that rapidly detect stimulus-specific intracellular protein phosphorylation and association, with specific emphasis on identifying phosphoproteins associated with p65, a nuclear regulatory factor. The analytical strategy includes immunoprecipitation of the target protein along with its associated proteins, tryptic digestion directly on the antibody beads, on-plate phosphopeptide enrichment for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) to identify phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites.

In this study, we demonstrate increased sensitivity of detection of multi-phosphorylated peptides of beta casein without using phosphopeptide enrichment techniques. Proteinase K digestion alone increased the detection limit of beta casein multi-phosphorylated peptides in the LC-MS analysis almost 500 fold, compared to conventional trypsin digestion (~50 pmol). In order to understand this effect, various factors affecting the ionization of phosphopeptides were investigated. Unlike ionizations of phosphopeptides with minor modifications, those of multi-phosphorylated peptides appeared to be subject to effects such as selectively suppressed ionization by more ionizable peptides and decreased ionization efficiency by multi-phosphorylation. The enhanced detection limit of multi- phosphorylated peptides resulting from proteinase K digestion was validated using a complex protein sample, namely a lysate of HEK 293 cells.

A method to assess the statistical significance of identified phosphopeptides was also formulated. PhosphoHunter performance was tested on a dataset of 1500\u2009MS/MS spectra and it was compared with two other tools: Mascot and Inspect.

Purified 14-3-3-binding proteins included sucrose-phosphate synthase, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, glutamine synthetases, a protein (LIM17) that has been implicated in early floral development, an approximately 20 kDa protein whose mRNA is induced by NaCl, and a calcium-dependent protein kinase that was capable of phosphorylating and rendering nitrate reductase (NR) sensitive to inhibition by 14-3-3 proteins.

{"text": "Combining Homologous Recombination and Phosphopeptide-binding Data to Predict the Impact of BRCA1 BRCT Variants on Cancer Risk. BRCA1 mutations have been identified that increase the risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Genetic screening is now offered to patients with a family history of cancer, to adapt their treatment and the management of their relatives. However, a large number of BRCA1 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are detected. To better understand the significance of these variants, a high-throughput structural and functional analysis was performed on a large set of BRCA1 VUS. Information on both cellular localization and homology-directed DNA repair (HR) capacity was obtained for 78 BRCT missense variants in the UMD-BRCA1 database and measurement of the structural stability and phosphopeptide-binding capacities was performed for 42 mutated BRCT domains. This extensive and systematic analysis revealed that most characterized causal variants affect BRCT-domain solubility in bacteria and all impair BRCA1 HR activity in cells. Furthermore, binding to a set of 5 different phosphopeptides was tested: all causal variants showed phosphopeptide-binding defects and no neutral variant showed such defects. A classification is presented on the basis of mutated BRCT domain solubility, phosphopeptide-binding properties, and VUS HR capacity. These data suggest that HR-defective variants, which present, in addition, BRCT domains either insoluble in bacteria or defective for phosphopeptide binding, lead to an increased cancer risk. Furthermore, the data suggest that variants with a WT HR activity and whose BRCT domains bind with a WT affinity to the 5 phosphopeptides are neutral. The case of variants with WT HR activity and defective phosphopeptide binding should be further characterized, as this last functional defect might be sufficient per se to lead to tumorigenesis.

Affinity-purified insulin-like growth factor I receptor kinase is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of its beta subunit. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors are partially purified from human placenta by sequential affinity chromatography with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and agarose derivatized with an IGF-I analog. Adsorption specificity to this affinity matrix demonstrates that low coupling ratios of IGF-I analog to agarose yield preparations that are highly selective in purifying IGF-I receptor with minimal cross-contamination by the insulin receptor present in the same placental extracts. Incubation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with [gamma-32P]ATP results in a marked phosphorylation of the receptor beta subunits, which appear as a doublet of Mr = 93,000 and 95,000 upon electrophoresis on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 32P-labeled receptor beta subunit doublet contains predominantly phosphotyrosine and to a much lesser extent phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation exhibits tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous histone. The characteristics of the IGF-I receptor-associated tyrosine kinase are remarkably similar to those of the insulin receptor kinase. Thus, prior phosphorylation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP results in a progressive activation of the receptor-associated histone kinase activity. A maximal (10-fold) activation is achieved between 0.25 and 1 mM ATP. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximal (30 microM) activation of the IGF-I receptor kinase is similar to that of the insulin receptor kinase.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor beta subunit doublet is enhanced by 7-8-fold when reductant is included in the reaction medium, as is observed for the insulin receptor kinase. Significantly, the dose responses of both receptor types to reductant are identical.

The cellular mechanisms exerting negative control over PLCgamma1 activation, however, remain unaddressed. Here by using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we show that the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutively associates with PLCgamma1 via its C-terminal domain and conditionally interacts with VEGFR-2 via the N-terminal/TKB domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of VEGFR-2 showed that full activation of c-Cbl requires its direct association with phospho-tyrosines 1052 and 1057 of VEGFR-2 via its TKB domain and indirect association with phospho-tyrosine 1173 of VEGFR-2 via PLCgamma1. The tertiary complex formation between VEGFR-2, PLCgamma1 and c-Cbl selectively promotes ubiquitylation and suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 by a proteolysis-independent mechanism.

Thus, in this paper, different phosphopeptide enrichment strategies were pursued, based either on metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC, in the form of commercial TiO2 spin columns or magnetic graphitized carbon black-TiO2 composite), or on immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC, in the form of Ti4+-IMAC magnetic material or commercial Fe3+-IMAC spin columns). While MOAC strategies proved completely unsuccessful, probably due to interfering phospholipids displacing phosphopeptides, the IMAC materials performed very well. Different sample preparation strategies were tested, comprising direct dilution with the loading buffer, organic solvent precipitation, and lipid removal from the matrix, as well as the addition of phosphatase inhibitors during sample handling for maximized endogenous phosphopeptide enrichment. All data were acquired by a shotgun peptidomics approach, in which peptide samples were separated by reversed-phase nanoHPLC hyphenated with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The devised method allowed the identification of 176 endogenous phosphopeptides in fresh serum added with inhibitors by the direct dilution protocol and the Ti4+-IMAC magnetic material enrichment, but good results could also be obtained from the commercial Fe3+-IMAC spin column adapted to the batch enrichment protocol.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 97, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 213, "charStart": 99}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 330, "charStart": 215}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 568, "charStart": 332}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 948, "charStart": 570}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1112, "charStart": 950}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1408, "charStart": 1114}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1591, "charStart": 1410}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1912, "charStart": 1593}], "mesh": ["Chromatography, Affinity", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Humans", "Magnetics", "Magnets", "Phosphopeptides", "Proteomics", "Solid Phase Extraction", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry", "Titanium"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

A novel detection method for the analysis of multi-phosphopeptides using microcolumn high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (microHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was proposed by the dephosphorylation treatment of alkaline phosphatase (AP). After the selective enrichment by a microcolumn packed with TiO2, phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests of beta-casein were dephosphorylated by AP. Through the removal of phosphate groups, the detection of multi-phosphopeptides according to the non-phosphorylated ones was achieved by ESI-MS/MS.

Several studies have indicated that prolactin (PRL) assumes oligomeric, proteolytically cleaved, phosphorylated and glycosylated forms.

In the present study, we examined whether or not PRL is present in the mouse pituitary gland in the phosphorylated form. Mouse pituitary PRL was digested with acid phosphatase, resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and then immunoblotted against the anti-PRL, anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. We also examined whether PRL is phosphorylated by protein kinases and semi-quantified the ratios of PPRL to PRL in the pituitary gland. The results indicated that three types of PRL are present in the pituitary glands of both male and female mice.

The propagation of phosphorylation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is a key dynamic cellular event involved in signal transduction, which is often deregulated in disease states such as cancer. Probing phosphorylation dynamics is therefore crucial for understanding receptor tyrosine kinases' function and finding ways to inhibit their effects. MS methods combined with metabolic labeling such as stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) have already proven successful in deciphering temporal phosphotyrosine perturbations. However, they are limited in terms of multiplexing, and they also are time consuming, because several experiments need to be performed separately. Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on 5-plex SILAC that allows monitoring of phosphotyrosine signaling perturbations induced by a drug treatment in one single experiment. Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318 unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast cancer cell line model. Hierarchical clustering of the time profiles followed by pathway enrichment analysis highlighted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2 signaling as the major pathways affected by erlotinib, thereby validating the method. Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to those of other proteins in the ErbB pathways, the phosphorylation at Tyr453 of protein FAM59A, a recently described adaptor of EGFR, was confirmed as tightly involved in the signaling cascade. The present investigation also demonstrates the remote effect of EGFR inhibition on ErbB3 phosphorylation sites such as Tyr1289 and Tyr1328, as well as a potential feedback effect on Tyr877 of ErbB2.

The biotinylated compound is a dinuclear zinc(II) complex that is suitable for accessing phosphate anions as a bridging ligand on the two zinc(II) ions.

Detection of the phosphate group by the zinc(II) complex, however, was independent of the phosphorylated amino acid residues. The calibration curve for the phosphorylation ratios was established with a calibration chip, on which phosphoserine-containing peptide probes were immobilized. The peptide probes, which were phosphorylated on the surface by protein kinase A, were detected and quantified by SPR imaging using the zinc(II) complex, SA, and anti-SA antibody.

{"text": "Discovering and validating unknown phospho-sites from p38 and HuR protein kinases in vitro by Phosphoproteomic and Bioinformatic tools. BACKGROUND: The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are known to be deregulated in many human malignancies. Phosphopeptide identification of protein-kinases and site determination are major challenges in biomedical mass spectrometry (MS). P38 and HuR protein kinases have been reported extensively in the general principles of signalling pathways modulated by phosphorylation, mainly by molecular biology and western blotting techniques. Thus, although it has been demonstrated they are phosphorylated in different stress/stimuli conditions, the phosphopeptides and specific amino acids in which the phosphate groups are located in those protein kinases have not been shown completely. METHODS: We have combined different resins: (a) IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Capture), (b) TiO2 (Titanium dioxide) and (c) SIMAC (Sequential Elution from IMAC) to isolate phosphopeptides from p38 and HuR protein kinases in vitro.Different phosphopeptide MS strategies were carried out by the LTQ ion Trap mass spectrometer (Thermo): (a) Multistage activation (MSA) and (b) Neutral loss MS3 (DDNLMS3).In addition, Molecular Dynamics (MD) bioinformatic simulation has been applied in order to simulate, over a period of time, the effects of the presence of the extra phosphate group (and the associated negative charge) in the overall structure and behaviour of the protein HuR.This study is supported by the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent ethical guidelines. RESULTS: The combination of these techniques allowed for:(1) The identification of 6 unknown phosphopeptides of these protein kinases. (2) Amino acid site assignments of the phosphate groups from each identified phosphopeptide, including manual validation by inspection of all the spectra. (3) The analyses of the phosphopeptides discovered were carried out in four triplicate experiments to avoid false positives getting high reproducibility in all the isolated phosphopeptides recovered from both protein kinases. (4) Computer simulation using MD techniques allowed us to get functional models of both structure and interactions of the previously mentioned phosphorylated kinases and the differences between their phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated forms.

Evidence from electrophysiological and ion flux studies has established that dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels are subject to regulation by neurotransmitter-mediated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. In the present study, we have further characterized the phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a multifunctional Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase of the membrane-associated form of the 165-kDa polypeptide identified as the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor. The initial rates of phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by both protein kinases were found to be relatively good compared to the rates of phosphorylation of established substrates of the enzymes. Phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by both protein kinases was additive. Prior phosphorylation by either one of the kinases alone did not preclude phosphorylation by the second kinase. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated the 165-kDa peptide preferentially at serine residues, although a small amount of phosphothreonine was also formed. In contrast, after phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, slightly more phosphothreonine than phosphoserine was recovered. Phosphopeptide mapping indicated that the two kinases phosphorylated the peptide at distinct as well as similar sites. Notably, one major site phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was not phosphorylated by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, while other sites were phosphorylated to a high degree by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, but to a much lesser degree by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results show that the 165-kDa dihydropyridine receptor from skeletal muscle can be multiply phosphorylated at distinct sites by the cAMP- and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. As the 165-kDa peptide may be the major functional unit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channel, the results suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent modulation of Ca channel activity by neurotransmitters may involve phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide at multiple sites.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 119, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 343, "charStart": 121}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 628, "charStart": 345}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 828, "charStart": 630}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 905, "charStart": 830}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1017, "charStart": 907}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1182, "charStart": 1019}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1352, "charStart": 1184}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1471, "charStart": 1354}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1785, "charStart": 1473}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1972, "charStart": 1787}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2253, "charStart": 1974}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Calcium Channels", "Dihydropyridines", "In Vitro Techniques", "Muscles", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Rabbits", "Receptors, Nicotinic"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

We have investigated the role of phosphorylation of the capsid protein of the avian hepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus in viral replication. We found previously that three serines and one threonine in the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the capsid protein serve as phosphorylation sites and that the pattern of phosphorylation at these sites in intracellular viral capsids is complex. In this study, we present evidence that the phosphorylation state of three of these residues affects distinct steps in viral replication. By substituting these residues with alanine in order to mimic serine, or with aspartic acid in order to mimic phosphoserine, and assaying the effects of these substitutions on various steps in virus replication, we were able to make the following inferences.

Peptide 1071--1080 mimicked the production of S1 and S2 in tryptic maps yielding a doublet of phosphopeptides, each containing phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine, which comigrated exactly with S1 and S2. Comigration was confirmed at a different pH and by mixing experiments. Radiosequenation showed that serine 1078 was phosphorylated. Tyrosine 1075 was also phosphorylated, but it was no more than a minor site in vivo. It is concluded that serine 1078 of the insulin receptor is a major site of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro.

In this study, potential cellular enzymes involved in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) L-directed Nup phosphorylation were screened with a panel of specific, cell-permeating kinase inhibitors. Extracellular signal-regulated receptor kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (U0126 and SB203580) were sufficient to block Nup hyperphosphorylation in EMCV-infected or L-expressing cells. Recombinant L alone, in the absence of infection, triggered activation of ERK and p38, independent of their upstream signaling cascades. Conserved residues within the L zinc finger (Cys(19)) and acidic domain (Asp(48),(51),(52),(55)) were essential for this activation and for the phosphorylation of Nups, suggesting that the phenomena are linked. Analysis of the hyperphosphorylated Nup species revealed only phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The sizes of the tryptic phosphopeptides derived from Nup62 were compatible with sites in the Phe/Gly repeat domain which display common consensus sequences for ERK and p38 substrates.

These peptides are synthesized in S phase but modified by phosphorylation during G2/mitosis transition. The epitope for the MPM-2 is a phosphorylated site. In this study, we attempted to determine which amino acids are phosphorylated during the G2-mitosis (M) transition. We raised a polyclonal antibody against one of the antigens recognized by MPM-2, i.e. a protein of 55 kDa, that is present in interphase cells but modified by phosphorylation during mitosis. This antibody recognizes the p55 protein in both interphase and mitosis while it is recognized by the monoclonal antibody MPM-2 only in mitotic cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis of protein p55 from 32P-labeled S-phase and M-phase HeLa cell extracts after immunoprecipitation with anti-p55 antibodies revealed that threonine was extensively phosphorylated in p55 during G2-M but not in S phase, whereas serine was phosphorylated during both S and M phases. Tyrosine was not phosphorylated. Identical results were obtained when antigens recognized by MPM-2 were subjected to similar analysis.

Each B-Myb phosphorylation site contained a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine followed by a proline, suggesting that this phosphorylation is due to a proline-directed kinase. Cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes each phosphorylated B-Myb in a cell-free system on the same sites as in intact cells. Furthermore, the ability of B-Myb to activate a reporter plasmid was enhanced by the cotransfection of cyclin A, whereas mutagenesis of the 10 identified phosphorylation sites from B-Myb blocked the effect of cyclin A coexpression. Additional analysis revealed that the effect of phosphorylation on B-Myb transactivation potential was enhanced by phosphorylation sites in its carboxyl-terminal half. One phosphorylation site (Ser(581)) appeared to negatively regulate DNA binding, as mutation of this site enhanced the ability of B-Myb to bind a Myb-binding sequence.

HNF-4\u03b1 regulates a large number of liver-specific genes, many of which are modulated by injury. While HNF-4\u03b1 function is regulated by phosphorylation, only a limited number of phosphorylation sites in HNF-4\u03b1 have been identified, and the roles of HNF-4\u03b1 phosphorylation after injury are unexplored. To address these issues, we have carried out an extensive quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of HNF-4\u03b1 serine and threonine phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation. Studies were performed in HNF-4\u03b1-enriched HepG2 cells treated with cytokines for 3 h or left untreated, followed by chemical derivatization of the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues using stable isotopic variants of dithiothreitol (DTT) and MS analysis. This has allowed the identification and relative quantification of 12 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in HNF-4\u03b1. Eight of these phosphorylation sites and their sensitivity to cytokine stimulation have not been previously reported.

The phosphorylation of HNF-4\u03b1 mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) significantly reduces HNF-4\u03b1 binding activity, which mimics the repressive effect of cytokines on HNF-4\u03b1 binding, and the inhibition of PKA activity by PKA inhibitor can partially recover the reduced HNF-4\u03b1 binding activity induced by cytokines.

Shotgun proteomics typically uses multidimensional LC/MS/MS analysis of enzymatically digested proteins, where strong cation-exchange (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP) separations are coupled to increase the separation power and dynamic range of analysis. Here we report an on-line multidimensional LC method using an anion- and cation-exchange mixed bed for the first separation dimension. The mixed-bed ion-exchange resin improved peptide recovery over SCX resins alone and showed better orthogonality to RP separations in two-dimensional separations. The Donnan effect, which was enhanced by the introduction of fixed opposite charges in one column, is proposed as the mechanism responsible for improved peptide recovery by producing higher fluxes of salt cations and lower populations of salt anions proximal to the SCX phase. An increase in orthogonality was achieved by a combination of increased retention for acidic peptides and moderately reduced retention of neutral to basic peptides by the added anion-exchange resin. The combination of these effects led to approximately 100% increase in the number of identified peptides from an analysis of a tryptic digest of a yeast whole cell lysate. The application of the method to phosphopeptide-enriched samples increased by 94% phosphopeptide identifications over SCX alone. The lower pKa of phosphopeptides led to specific enrichment in a single salt step resolving acidic phosphopeptides from other phospho- and non-phosphopeptides.

Here, we implement weak anion exchange (WAX) chromatography as an additional, complementary dimension to strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase (RP). Initially, we used SCX to fractionate a human lysate digest to generate a fraction highly enriched for phosphopeptides. Analysis of this single fraction by RP-LC-MS with a 140 min gradient method allowed the identification of 4045 unique phosphopeptides (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%; Mascot score > 20) using an Orbitrap Velos. Triplicate analysis (420 min total gradient time) of the same sample increased the total to just over 5000 unique phosphopeptides.

We performed a more comprehensive, albeit also more time-consuming, analysis of the same 14 WAX fractions by the use of 140 min gradient LC-MS analyses, which resulted in the detection of over 11\u2009000 unique phosphopeptides.

The association of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a central tyrosine kinase in B cell signaling, with Vav SH2 domain is controlled by phosphorylation of two closely spaced tyrosines in Syk linker B: Y342 and Y346. Previous studies established both singly phosphorylated and doubly phosphorylated forms play a role in signaling. The structure of the doubly phosphorylated form identified a new recognition of phosphotyrosine whereby two phosphotyrosines bind simultaneously to the Vav SH2 domain, one in the canonical pTyr pocket and one in the specificity pocket on the opposite side of the central \u03b2-sheet. It is unknown if the specificity pocket can bind phosphotyrosine independent of phosphotyrosine binding the pTyr pocket. To address this gap in knowledge, we determined the structure of the complex between Vav1 SH2 and a peptide (SykLB-YpY) modeling the singly phosphorylated-Y346 form of Syk with unphosphorylated Y342. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data conclusively establish that recognition of phosphotyrosine is swapped between the two pockets; phosphorylated pY346 binds the specificity pocket of Vav1 SH2, and unphosphorylated Y342 occupies what is normally the pTyr binding pocket. Nearly identical changes in chemical shifts occurred upon binding all three forms of singly and doubly phosphorylated peptides; however, somewhat smaller shift perturbations for SykLB-YpY from residues in regions of high internal mobility suggest that internal motions are coupled to binding affinity.

The ionization of phosphorylated peptides in positive ion mode mass spectrometry is generally less efficient compared with the ionization of their non-phosphorylated counterparts. This can make phosphopeptides much more difficult to detect. One way to enhance the detection of phosphorylated proteins and peptides is by selectively isolating these species. Current approaches of phosphopeptide isolation are based on the favorable interactions of phosphate groups with immobilized metals. While these methods can be effective in the extraction, they can lead to incomplete sample recovery, particularly for the most strongly bound multiply phosphorylated components. A non-sorptive method of phosphopeptide isolation using capillary electrophoresis (CE) was recently reported [Zhang et al., Anal. Chem. 77 (2005) 6078]. The relatively low isoelectric points of phosphopeptides cause them to remain anionic at acidic sample pH. Hence, they can be selectively injected into the capillary by an applied field after the electroosmotic flow (EOF) is suppressed. The technique was previously coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). In this work, the exploitation of selective sampling in conjugation with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is presented. The transition was not immediately straightforward. A number of major alterations were necessary for ESI interfacing. These adaptations include the choice of a suitable capillary coating for EOF control and the incorporation of organic solvent for efficient ESI. As expected, selective injection of phosphopeptides greatly enhanced the sensitivity of their detection in ESI-MS, particularly for the multiply phosphorylated species that were traditionally most problematic. Furthermore, an electrophoretic separation subsequent to the selective injection of the phosphopeptides was performed prior to analysis by ESI-MS.

Base elution in ammonium hydroxide or ammonium phosphate provided optimal specificity and recovery of phosphorylated peptides.

One weakness inherent to current enrichment strategies is poor binding of phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues. The problem is exacerbated when strong cation exchange (SCX) is used for pre-fractionation, as under low pH SCX conditions phosphorylated peptides with multiple basic residues elute with the bulk of the tryptic digest and therefore require more stringent enrichment. Here, we report a systematic evaluation of the characteristics of a novel phosphopeptide enrichment approach based on a combination of low pH SCX and Ti(4+)-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) comparing it one-to-one with the well established low pH SCX-TiO(2) enrichment method. We also examined the effect of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFP), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in the loading buffer, as it has been hypothesized that high levels of TFA and the perfluorinated solvent HFP improve the enrichment of phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues. We found that Ti(4+)-IMAC in combination with TFA in the loading buffer, outperformed all other methods tested, enabling the identification of around 5000 unique phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues from 400 \u03bcg of a HeLa cell lysate digest. In comparison, \u223c 2000 unique phosphopeptides could be identified by Ti(4+)-IMAC with HFP and close to 3000 by TiO(2). We confirmed, by motif analysis, the basic phosphopeptides enrich the number of putative basophilic kinases substrates. In addition, we performed an experiment using the SCX/Ti(4+)-IMAC methodology alongside the use of collision-induced dissociation (CID), higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) and electron transfer dissociation with supplementary activation (ETD) on considerably more complex sample, consisting of a total of 400 \u03bcg of triple dimethyl labeled MCF-7 digest.

The characterization of phosphorylation state(s) of a protein is best accomplished by using isolated or enriched phosphoprotein samples or their corresponding phosphopeptides. The process is typically time-consuming as, often, a combination of analytical approaches must be used. To facilitate throughput in the study of phosphoproteins, a microreactor that enables a novel strategy for performing fast proteolytic digestion and selective phosphopeptide enrichment was developed. The microreactor was fabricated using 100\u00a0\u03bcm i.d. fused-silica capillaries packed with 1-2\u00a0mm beds of C18 and/or TiO2 particles. Proteolytic digestion-only, phosphopeptide enrichment-only, and sequential proteolytic digestion/phosphopeptide enrichment microreactors were developed and tested with standard protein mixtures. The protein samples were adsorbed on the C18 particles, quickly digested with a proteolytic enzyme infused over the adsorbed proteins, and further eluted onto the TiO2 microreactor for enrichment in phosphopeptides. A number of parameters were optimized to speed up the digestion and enrichments processes, including microreactor dimensions, sample concentrations, digestion time, flow rates, buffer compositions, and pH. The effective time for the steps of proteolytic digestion and enrichment was less than 5\u00a0min. For simple samples, such as standard protein mixtures, this approach provided equivalent or better results than conventional bench-top methods, in terms of both enzymatic digestion and selectivity. Analysis times and reagent costs were reduced ~10- to 15-fold. Preliminary analysis of cell extracts and recombinant proteins indicated the feasibility of integration of these microreactors in more advanced workflows amenable for handling real-world biological samples.

Because functionally significant substrates for the tyrosyl protein kinase activity of pp60v-src are likely to include membrane-associated proteins involved in normal growth control, we have tested the hypothesis that pp60v-src could phosphorylate and alter the signaling activity of transmembrane growth factor receptors. We have found that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor becomes constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells transformed by the src oncogene and in addition displays elevated levels of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. High-performance liquid chromatography phosphopeptide mapping revealed two predominant sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, both of which differed from the major sites of receptor autophosphorylation; thus, the src-induced phosphorylation is unlikely to occur via an autocrine mechanism.

OBJECTIVE: Reversible serine/threonine protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases plays a crucial role in cellular growth and differentiation. We attempted to determine the subcellular location of serine/threonine phosphatase (protein phosphatase type 2A [PP2A]) in endometrial cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial cancers surgically removed were examined. PP2A activity was assessed by measuring the dephosphorylation of phosphopeptide highly selective for the PP2A in cytosol and membranes fractionated on a continuous sucrose density gradient. Its protein level was detected by immunoblotting with a specific antibody. RESULTS: There were three peaks of PP2A enzyme activity and immunoreactivity corresponding by marker enzyme analysis to the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum fractions. An enzyme kinetic analysis showed the different activity in cytosol and plasma membrane; K(m) values of 98+/-12 micromol/L for cytosol and 32+/-6.2 micromol/L for plasma membrane (P<.01), respectively. The membrane phosphatase was sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid and sodium fluoride, characteristics suggestive of PP2A activity. CONCLUSION: PP2A activity in the plasma membrane of endometrial cancers might be distinct from that present in the cytosol.

We have characterized the interaction of the APLF FHA domain with phosphorylated XRCC1 peptides using crystallographic, NMR, and fluorescence polarization studies. The FHA-FBM interactions exhibit significant pH dependence in the physiological range as a consequence of the atypically high pK values of the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues and the preference for a dianionic charge state of FHA-bound pThr. These high pK values are characteristic of the polyanionic peptides typically produced by CK2 phosphorylation. Binding affinity is greatly enhanced by residues flanking the crystallographically-defined recognition motif, apparently as a consequence of non-specific electrostatic interactions, supporting the role of XRCC1 in nuclear cotransport of APLF.

Following autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397, FAK binds the Src homology 2 domains of Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, among several other possible binding partners. To further investigate the role of phosphorylated FAK in cell migration in situ, peptides comprising residues 391-406 of human FAK with caged phosphotyrosine 397 were synthesized. Although the caged phosphopeptides were stable to phosphatase activity, the free phosphopeptides showed a half-life of approximately 10-15 min in cell lysates. Migrating NBT-II cells (a rat bladder tumor cell line) were microinjected with the caged FAK peptide and locally photoactivated using a focused laser beam. The photoactivation of caged FAK peptide in 8-microm diameter spots over the cell body led to the temporary arrest of the leading edge migration within approximately 1 min of irradiation. In contrast, cell body migration was not inhibited.

The Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) acts as a central regulator of mitosis and is over-expressed in a wide range of human tumours where high levels of expression correlate with a poor prognosis. PLK1 comprises two structural elements, a kinase domain and a polo-box domain (PBD). The PBD binds phosphorylated substrates to control substrate phosphorylation by the kinase domain. Although the PBD preferentially binds to phosphopeptides, it has a relatively broad sequence specificity in comparison with other phosphopeptide binding domains. We analysed the molecular determinants of recognition by performing molecular dynamics simulations of the PBD with one of its natural substrates, CDC25c. Predicted binding free energies were calculated using a molecular mechanics, Poisson-Boltzmann surface area approach. We calculated the per-residue contributions to the binding free energy change, showing that the phosphothreonine residue and the mainchain account for the vast majority of the interaction energy. This explains the very broad sequence specificity with respect to other sidechain residues. Finally, we considered the key role of bridging water molecules at the binding interface. We employed inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory to consider the free energy of water molecules on the protein surface with respect to bulk water molecules. Such an analysis highlights binding hotspots created by elimination of water molecules from hydrophobic surfaces. It also predicts that a number of water molecules are stabilized by the presence of the charged phosphate group, and that this will have a significant effect on the binding affinity.

The major quantitation strategies are stable isotopic labeling of proteins and peptides for in vitro cell culture systems (stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture, SILAC) or isobaric peptide labels such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tags (TMT) for both in vitro and in vivo systems.

In order to immobilize Ti4+ ions on the surface of the magnetite nanoparticles, they were first covered by a silica shell and then modified to expose at the surface bromine containing groups. Glycidyl methacrylate was subsequently polymerized from these groups using the \"grafting from\" approach by the activator regenerated by electron transfer-atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET-ATRP) technique. Finally, the glycidyl groups were reacted with iminodiacetic acid to functionalize the material with moieties suitable for coordination. The prepared material was extensively characterized and subsequently tested for enrichment of a bovine serum albumin mixture with casein to ascertain its potential. With positive results, the new magnetic polymeric material was further employed to set up an enrichment method on yeast protein digest based on shotgun proteomics.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is one of the most important post-translational modifications, while the detection of phosphopeptides is difficult due to their low abundance and the signal suppression of nonphosphorylated peptides. Therefore, selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from highly complicated mixtures is vital for MS-based phosphoproteome analysis. Despite various strategies have been developed, there is no single method that is capable of providing full coverage of the whole phosphoproteome. Metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) enrichment preferably singly phosphopeptides, whereas immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment bias towards multiply phosphopeptides.

Enrichment of modified peptides from global peptides is inevitable in mass spectrometric analysis protein modifications because of their importance in the study of cellular functions and low abundance in the global proteomic analysis. Recent advances in enrichment methods for modified peptides such as phosphopeptides and intact glycopeptides (IGPs) show that the methods for proteomic analyses of both protein modifications are robust. We have recently observed and reported a large number of IGPs from phosphoproteomic analysis using IMAC-based phosphopeptides enrichment procedure. To determine whether phosphorylated peptides could be specifically isolated from coenriched IGPs in IMAC experiments with different pH, IMAC procedures were performed at different pH conditions, and we found that the enrichment of phosphopeptides at pH 2.0 was the optimal condition for having the highest number of phosphopeptide identifications; however, coenrichment of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides was inevitable in the entire pH range. The hydrophilic enrichments of IGPs performed before or after IMAC enrichment were evaluated subsequently to determine the optimal workflow for simultaneous analyses of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides, and IMAC enrichment followed by hydrophilic enrichment was chosen as the optimized workflow. Applying the workflow to the TMT-labeled peptides from luminal and basal-like type of breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models allowed quantitative analyses of phospho- and glycoproteomics with 17582 phosphopeptides and 3468 glycopeptides identified, and 1237 phosphopeptides and 236 glycopeptides showed significant expression differences between luminal and basal-like, respectively.

Thus, neurodegeneration in the brain is related to altered tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the brain and identification of abnormally phosphorylated tyrosine peptides in CSF has the potential to ascertain candidate biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: In this study, we used an antibody-based tyrosine phosphopeptide enrichment method coupled with high resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Lumos Fourier transform mass spectrometer to catalog tyrosine phosphorylated peptides from cerebrospinal fluid. The subset of identified tyrosine phosphorylated peptides was also validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted approach. Results: To date, there are no published studies on global profiling of phosphotyrosine modifications of CSF proteins. We carried out phosphotyrosine profiling of CSF using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-based enrichment and analysis using high resolution Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer.

{"docId": "15647109", "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 148}, "text": "Fully automated synthesis of (phospho)peptide arrays in microtiter plate wells provides efficient access to protein tyrosine kinase characterization. BACKGROUND: Synthetic peptides have played a useful role in studies of protein kinase substrates and interaction domains. Synthetic peptide arrays and libraries, in particular, have accelerated the process. Several factors have hindered or limited the applicability of various techniques, such as the need for deconvolution of combinatorial libraries, the inability or impracticality of achieving full automation using two-dimensional or pin solid phases, the lack of convenient interfacing with standard analytical platforms, or the difficulty of compartmentalization of a planar surface when contact between assay components needs to be avoided. This paper describes a process for synthesis of peptides and phosphopeptides on microtiter plate wells that overcomes previous limitations and demonstrates utility in determination of the epitope of an autophosphorylation site phospho-motif antibody and utility in substrate utilization assays of the protein tyrosine kinase, p60c-src. RESULTS: The overall reproducibility of phospho-peptide synthesis and multiplexed EGF receptor (EGFR) autophosphorylation site (pY1173) antibody ELISA (9H2) was within 5.5 to 8.0%. Mass spectrometric analyses of the released (phospho)peptides showed homogeneous peaks of the expected molecular weights. An overlapping peptide array of the complete EGFR cytoplasmic sequence revealed a high redundancy of 9H2 reactive sites. The eight reactive phospopeptides were structurally related and interestingly, the most conserved antibody reactive peptide motif coincided with a subset of other known EGFR autophosphorylation and SH2 binding motifs and an EGFR optimal substrate motif. Finally, peptides based on known substrate specificities of c-src and related enzymes were synthesized in microtiter plate array format and were phosphorylated by c-Src with the predicted specificities. The level of phosphorylation was proportional to c-Src concentration with sensitivities below 0.1 Units of enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of this method to interface with various robotics and instrumentation is highly flexible since the microtiter plate is an industry standard. It is highly scalable by increasing the surface area within the well or the number of wells and does not require specialized robotics. The microtiter plate array system is well suited to the study of protein kinase substrates, antigens, binding molecules, and inhibitors since these all can be quantitatively studied at a single uniform, reproducible interface.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 148, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 270, "charStart": 150}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 355, "charStart": 272}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 796, "charStart": 357}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1132, "charStart": 798}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1313, "charStart": 1134}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1435, "charStart": 1315}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1556, "charStart": 1437}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1810, "charStart": 1558}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 2013, "charStart": 1812}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2128, "charStart": 2015}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2294, "charStart": 2130}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2429, "charStart": 2296}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2656, "charStart": 2431}], "mesh": ["Antigen-Antibody Reactions", "Automation", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "ErbB Receptors", "Mass Spectrometry", "Peptide Fragments", "Peptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphotyrosine", "Polylysine", "Protein Array Analysis", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Reproducibility of Results", "Robotics"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that governs biological processes. Despite the fact that a number of analytical strategies have been exploited for the characterization of protein phosphorylation, the identification of protein phosphorylation sites is still challenging. We proposed here an alternative approach to mine phosphopeptide signals generated from a mixture of proteins when liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis is involved. The approach combined dephosphorylation reaction, accurate mass measurements from a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a computing algorithm to differentiate possible phosphopeptide signals obtained from the LC-MS analyses by taking advantage of the mass shift generated by alkaline phosphatase treatment. The retention times and m/z values of these selected LC-MS signals were used to facilitate subsequent LC-MS/MS experiments for phosphorylation site determination. Unlike commonly used neutral loss scan experiments for phosphopeptide detection, this strategy may not bias against tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. We have demonstrated the applicability of this strategy to sequence more, in comparison with conventional data-dependent LC-MS/MS experiments, phosphopeptides in a mixture of alpha- and beta-caseins.

RATIONALE: A liquid matrix, 3-aminoquinoline (3-AQ)/\u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), introduced by Kolli et al. in 1996 for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), has been reported for peptides and proteins, oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides, and glycopeptides. However, it has not been validated for phosphopeptides. METHODS: We optimized sample preparation using 3-AQ/CHCA for phosphopeptides. The sensitivity of six phosphopeptide species as isolated or in digests was systematically evaluated by using MALDI-quadropole ion trap (QIT)-time of flight (TOF) MS in positive and negative ion modes, and compared with the conventional methods using a solid matrix, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHB). RESULTS: The sensitivity of mono- and tetraphosphopeptides was improved 10- to 10 000-fold with the optimized preparation method using 3-AQ/CHCA compared with the conventional methods using 2,5-DHB. Improvement by 3-AQ/CHCA itself was 10-fold. Adding ammonium dihydrogen phosphate or an analyte solvent composition was also effectively improved the sensitivity. Phosphopeptides in isolated form or in digests were detected at femto- or subfemtomole levels. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of phosphopeptides was improved by the optimized sample preparation method using 3-AQ/CHCA compared with the conventional method using 2,5-DHB. The validation of 3-AQ/CHCA for phosphopeptides was systematically confirmed, expanding the potential of this matrix to phosphoproteomics.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 167, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 471, "charStart": 169}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 527, "charStart": 473}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 605, "charStart": 529}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 909, "charStart": 607}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1108, "charStart": 911}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1153, "charStart": 1110}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1271, "charStart": 1155}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1366, "charStart": 1273}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1535, "charStart": 1368}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1674, "charStart": 1537}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Aminoquinolines", "Animals", "Caseins", "Chickens", "Coumaric Acids", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Ovalbumin", "Phosphopeptides", "Receptor, Insulin", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

A novel protein phosphatase cDNA of the PPP superfamily was identified from the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), and tentatively named PfPPJ. The predicted primary structure of the phosphatase contained all the known conserved motifs of the PPP superfamily essential for catalytic activity. The enzyme was specific for dephosphorylation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues with very little activity against phosphotyrosine residues. However, the sequence at its C-terminal end was unique, and was consistent with its resistance to the classical PP2A-specific inhibitors such as okadaic acid and microcystin-LR, and the PP1-specific inhibitor, mammalian heat-stable inhibitor-2 (I-2). Even the catalytic core of PfPPJ had a sequence substantially different from the other PPPs such that PfPPJ could be placed in an apparently separate phylogenetic branch.

A procedure for measuring the activity of tyrosine-specific protein kinases was developed. The method is based on the fact that the phosphoryl groups of phosphotyrosine residues of phosphorylated protein substrates are not hydrolyzed in alkaline solutions, whereas the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues lose their phosphoryl groups upon heating in 2 N KOH. It was demonstrated that rat sarcoma XC cells in culture and in solid tumours contain tyrosine-specific protein kinase (TPK). The TPK is localized in the membrane fraction of the cells and is solubilized by 1% Triton X-100. Mn2+-ATP is a nucleotide substrate for TPK. Among other protein substrates, TPK strongly phosphorylates histones H5 and H2a, weakly phosphorylates histones H2b, H4 and H1 but does not phosphorylate protamine, casein, vinculin or angiotensin II. The optimal concentration of Mn2+ for the reaction is 2 mM; the Km values for ATP and histone H5 are 2-3 microM and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively. Tyrosine-specific protein kinases phosphorylating histone H5 were detected in the membrane fraction isolated from different mammalian tissues, e. g., spleen, heart, liver, brain and lungs, as well as from human intestinal mucosa and mucosal adenocarcinoma.

Moreover, pp59 did not comigrate with any of the autophosphorylated subunits of the Ca(2+)/calmodulindependent protein kinase in rat cerebellar membranes. Extraction of pp59 from these membranes could be accomplished with 6 M urea, but not with 0.4 M NaCl or 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100.

The binding of a growth factor to its specific receptor catalyzes a complex cascade of intracellular signaling events, characterized by changes in the phosphorylation state of many key proteins. Among these phosphorylation events, tyrosine phosphorylation plays a prominent role in the transmission of postreceptor signals. The state of tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs). Dysregulation of either event can lead to abnormal cellular responses. PTPs generally act to regulate negatively-that is, to turn off-any signals generated by PTKs. However, this is not always the case, as seen by the phosphatase SHP-2, which can either be a positive or negative regulator of signal transduction depending on the particular cellular context. In addition, a novel family of dual specificity phosphatases has been recently discovered. These enzymes are capable of dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine/phosphoserine residues, and seem to play a significant role in attenuating the action of MAP kinases. Several themes appear throughout PTP regulation of growth factor signaling, including positive or negative regulation, importance of cell/ tissue type, identity of the receptor activated, and subcellular localization.

Possible role of mitogen-activated protein kinase on the okadaic acid-induced NF-kappaB activation. Most types of cells can produce interleukin (IL)-8 in response to various inflammatory stimuli. To study the role of protein phosphatases in the signal transduction leading to IL-8 production, a subline of HL-60 (C-15) was treated with okadaic acid (OA) and sodium orthovanadate (VA), inhibitors of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase, respectively. Both OA and VA dramatically increased IL-8 secretion up to 200-fold in the HL-60 cells. OA and VA stimulation was accompanied by a marked increase in IL-8 mRNA expression and also by activation of a transcription factor, NF-kappaB. In addition, an essential role of the NF-kappaB site in the IL-8 gene activation was confirmed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. IL-8 production by OA or VA was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, including staurosporine, H-7, K252a, herbimycin A, and genistein. Both OA and VA induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p44, which was presumed to be Erk1, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, with concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. In parallel, rapid degradation of IkappaB-alpha, an inhibitory component of NF-kappaB, was observed. Since OA-activated Erk1 phosphorylated recombinant IkappaB-alpha in vitro, we assumed that Erk1 is involved in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IkappaB-alpha, thus leading to the activation of IL-8 gene transcription.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 120, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 220, "charStart": 122}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 316, "charStart": 222}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 609, "charStart": 318}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 697, "charStart": 611}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 841, "charStart": 699}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 984, "charStart": 843}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1122, "charStart": 986}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1356, "charStart": 1124}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1457, "charStart": 1358}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1692, "charStart": 1459}], "mesh": ["Base Sequence", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases", "DNA", "HL-60 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrolysis", "Interleukin-8", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Molecular Sequence Data", "NF-kappa B", "Okadaic Acid", "Phosphorylation", "RNA, Messenger", "Tyrosine", "Vanadates"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

We have developed a new method for the quantification of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine as dabsyl derivatives in acid-hydrolyzed extracts of 32P-labeled A431 cells. In the first step the phosphamino acids are concentrated using a disposable anion-exchange column. Subsequently, the phosphoamino acid fraction is treated with dabsyl reagent (28.8 mM) for 10 min at 70 degrees C. After cleanup with a second anion-exchange column followed by separation on a disposable C18 column, the covalently modified phosphoamino acids are separated on silica TLC sheets using a one-dimensional solvent system. The major advantages of this method are the complete separation of dabsylated P-Ser, P-Thr, and P-Tyr on silica aluminum sheets in a very reproducible way without the interference of 32P contaminants originating from hydrolyzed cell extracts. Very clean chromatograms are obtained, enabling the fast and unambiguous quantification of the phosphoamino acids by simply cutting out the relevant spots from the aluminum sheets. A high sensitivity is achieved by the removal of the amino acids before derivatization of the sample. This allows the use of relatively low amounts of [32P]orthophosphate to load up the cells. Most important, the method allows the simultaneous analysis of dozens of samples within 1 day, making it a very convenient technique for routine analysis of the phosphorylation state of cultured cells.

In vitro assays revealed that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 may be at least partially responsible for SSP-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation observed in intact cells.

Removal of 12 residues from the carboxyl terminus of EDG1 completely inhibited SSP-mediated internalization, suggesting that this domain dictates susceptibility to receptor internalization while retaining sensitivity to SSP-stimulated phosphorylation.

The modification of intracellular proteins by monosaccharides of O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and dynamic PTM of metazoans. The addition and removal of O-GlcNAc is catalyzed by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase, respectively. One mechanism by which O-GlcNAc is thought to mediate proteins is by regulating phosphorylation. To provide insight into the pathways regulated by O-GlcNAc, we have utilized SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to carry out comparisons of site-specific phosphorylation in OGT wild-type and Null cells. Quantitation of the phosphoproteome demonstrated that of 5529 phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine sites, 232 phosphosites were upregulated and 133 downregulated in the absence of O-GlcNAc.

BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) promotes survival and migration of endothelial cells, in part through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways downstream of Tie-2 receptors. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues on target MAPKs. The mechanisms by which DUSPs modulate MAPK activation in Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor signaling are unknown in endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of various DUSPs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to Ang-1 was measured. The functional roles of DUSPs in Ang-1-induced regulation of MAPK activation, endothelial cell survival, migration, differentiation, and permeability were measured using selective siRNA oligos. Ang-1 differentially induces DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through activation of the PI-3 kinase, ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK pathways. Lack-of-function siRNA screening revealed that DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates p38 protein and is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration and differentiation. DUSP4 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK proteins and, under conditions of serum deprivation, is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration, several antiapoptotic effects, and differentiation. DUSP5 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2 proteins and is involved in cell survival and inhibition of permeability.

BACKGROUND: Molecular signaling events associated with the necroinflammatory changes in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not well understood. AIMS: To understand the molecular basis of NASH, we evaluated reversible phosphorylation events in hepatic tissue derived from Class III obese subjects by phosphoproteomic means with the aim of highlighting key regulatory pathways that distinguish NASH from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (also known as simple steatosis; SS). MATERIALS & METHODS: Class III obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery underwent liver biopsy (eight normal patients, eight with simple steatosis, and eight NASH patients). Our strategy was unbiased, comparing global differences in liver protein reversible phosphorylation events across the 24 subjects. RESULTS: Of the 3078 phosphorylation sites assigned (2465 phosphoserine, 445 phosphothreonine, 165 phosphotyrosine), 53 were altered by a factor of 2 among cohorts, and of those, 12 were significantly increased or decreased by ANOVA (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Statistical analyses of canonical signaling pathways identified carbohydrate metabolism and RNA post-transcriptional modification among the most over-represented networks.

Therefore, investigating the exact positions of phosphorylation sites in GPCRs sequence could provide useful clues for drug design and other biotechnology applications. Experimental identification of phosphorylation sites is expensive and laborious. Hence, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for reliable prediction of phosphorylation sites from amino acid sequences. In this article, we presented a simple and effective method to recognize phosphorylation sites of human GPCRs by combining amino acid hydrophobicity and support vector machine.

{"text": "Selective Sensing of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Peptides Using Terbium(III) Complexes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins, as well as their dephosphorylation, is closely related to various diseases. However, this phosphorylation is usually accompanied by more abundant phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the proteins and covers only 0.05% of the total phosphorylation. Accordingly, highly selective detection of phosphorylated tyrosine in proteins is an urgent subject. In this review, recent developments in this field are described. Monomeric and binuclear Tb(III) complexes, which emit notable luminescence only in the presence of phosphotyrosine (pTyr), have been developed. There, the benzene ring of pTyr functions as an antenna and transfers its photoexcitation energy to the Tb(III) ion as the emission center. Even in the coexistence of phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr), pTyr can be efficintly detected with high selectivity. Simply by adding these Tb(III) complexes to the solutions, phosphorylation of tyrosine in peptides by protein tyrosine kinases and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases can be successfully visualized in a real-time fashion.

The method makes use of the differential stabilities of phosphohistidine and the common phosphohydroxyamino acids to alkali and acid treatments to measure phosphohistidine incorporation. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are depleted by alkali treatment, while phosphohistidine, which is alkali-stable, is removed by acid treatment. Phosphotyrosine is stable to both alkali and acid treatments.

These are suggested to reflect a single site of phosphorylation, with proteolysis by trypsin being incomplete, and where C2 is larger than C1, which is larger than C3. An identical pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was seen in hepatocytes treated with either vasopressin or PMA, although labelling of this group of peptides was increased by approximately 2-fold compared with the basal state. In contrast, treatment of hepatocytes with glucagon, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP or forskolin not only resulted in increased labelling of the 'basal' sites approximately 3-fold, but identified a novel positively charged tryptic phosphoserine-containing peptide (AN). All four tryptic peptides were susceptible to proteolysis by V8 protease. Treatment of labelled alpha-Gi-2 from basal and PMA-treated cells produced a pattern of peptides which was identical with those found when the tryptic phosphopeptide was treated with V8 protease.

Primate lentiviruses encode for an unique nef gene with an essential function in both viral replication and pathogenicity in the host. The molecular basis for this function remains however poorly defined. Several Nef-binding cellular proteins are thought to be instrumental in its function. Indeed, Nef contains a proline-rich motif implicated in the binding to the Src-like tyrosine kinase Hck and also to a Ser/Thr kinase of molecular weight 62 kDa. The disruption of this motif affects the binding to both these kinases as well as viral replication. Whereas Hck is expressed in the myeloid lineage and hence may account for the nef function in infected monocytes, we and others have reported previously that Nef also interacts with the T-lymphocyte Src-kinase Lck, leading to specific cell signaling impairment. This interaction occurs through the binding of Nef to both Lck SH2 and SH3 domains. Both the proline motif and phosphorylation of Nef on tyrosine residue were proposed to account for these interactions. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Lck SH2 binding by HIV-1 Nef. Using recombinant fusion proteins to precipitate lysates, we show that although SH2 binding is dependent on phosphorylation events, it occurs in a tyrosine independent manner because it requires neither tyrosine residues in Nef nor the phosphotyrosine binding pocket from the Lck SH2 domain, hence suggesting a role for a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine residue. Further, we show that Hck SH2 does not interact with Nef, indicating that Hck SH3 binding is sufficient for Nef binding, whereas Lck SH2 cooperate together with SH3 to allow Nef binding to a level similar to Hck SH3. Together, our results establish different mechanisms for Hck and Lck binding by HIV-1 Nef protein, and identify a novel mechanism for Src-like tyrosine kinase targeting by a viral protein.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 158, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 293, "charStart": 160}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 363, "charStart": 295}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 449, "charStart": 365}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 610, "charStart": 451}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 711, "charStart": 612}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 973, "charStart": 713}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1057, "charStart": 975}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1176, "charStart": 1059}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1244, "charStart": 1178}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1611, "charStart": 1246}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1828, "charStart": 1613}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2017, "charStart": 1830}], "mesh": ["Gene Products, nef", "Genes, src", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein Conformation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck", "Virus Replication", "nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Treatment of murine macrophage monolayers with genistein, herbimycin A, tyrphostin 25 or staurosporine prior to infection decreased parasite invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Contrary, addition of sodium orthovanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phosphotyrosine and p-nitrophenyl phosphate to the interaction medium, significantly increased parasite binding and internalization, whereas phosphoserine and phosphothreonine had no effect. The phosphatase activity of intact promastigotes was greater than that of macrophages. Western blot analysis revealed tyrosine-phosphorylated bands from 198 to 28 kDa following macrophage challenge with promastigotes. Uninfected macrophages displayed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, possibly indicating an inducible process, while in parasites it was constitutive, as seen by the presence of 42, 40 and 35 kDa phosphoproteins on the Leishmania lysates. Immunofluorescence and immunogold detection of phosphotyrosine residues in some promastigote-macrophage attachment areas, but not in the vicinity of ingested parasites, suggest that Leishmania-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is an early, local and short-lived event. Genistein treatment of Leishmania-infected cells significantly enhanced the parasite burden.

E-cadherin is a transmembrane calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that is complexed with cytoplasmic proteins including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), and actin. We have identified two heterodimeric complexes which demonstrate that alpha-catenin interacts directly with beta-catenin, or with plakoglobin, in the absence of E-cadherin. beta-Catenin has previously been shown to bind directly to E-cadherin. We propose that E-cadherin associates with alpha-catenin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, via either beta-catenin or plakoglobin. We have further identified three new but related protein components of the E-cadherin complex, which are each cross-reactive by Western blot analysis to antibodies directed against p120, a phosphotyrosine substrate of src, and a phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine substrate of growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways.

The antagonist Arg0, Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7-BK completely inhibited the response indicating that BK was acting via a B2 kinin receptor.

We report that the corresponding amino-terminal phosphoserines of avian IkappaB-alpha are phosphorylation targets leading to inactivation of IkappaB-alpha upon stimulation. In addition, we show differential roles for these two serines. Mutation of serine 40 to alanine blocks all stimuli tested (TNF-alpha, phorbol ester, and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28), leading to NF-kappaB activation, while mutation of serine 36 to alanine attenuates only certain transduced signals (PMA, TNF-alpha). These novel findings support the hypothesis that the amino-terminal phosphoserine residues of avian IkappaB-alpha differentially mediate NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways and activation by distinct signals, thereby resulting in the activation NF-kappaB.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 72, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 235, "charStart": 74}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 334, "charStart": 237}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 492, "charStart": 336}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 665, "charStart": 494}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 728, "charStart": 667}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 976, "charStart": 730}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1235, "charStart": 978}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Apoptosis", "Birds", "Cell Line", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "I-kappa B Proteins", "Jurkat Cells", "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha", "NF-kappa B", "Phosphorylation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Serine", "Signal Transduction", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate", "Transfection", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The activation and recruitment of CD4(+) T cells are critical for the development of efficient antitumor immunity and may allow for the optimization of current cancer immunotherapy strategies. Searching for more optimal and selective targets for CD4(+) T cells, we have investigated phosphopeptides, a new category of tumor-derived epitopes linked to proteins with vital cellular functions. Although MHC I-restricted phosphopeptides have been identified, it was previously unknown whether human MHC II molecules present phosphopeptides for specific CD4(+) T cell recognition. We first demonstrated the fine specificity of human CD4(+) T cells to discriminate a phosphoresidue by using cells raised against the candidate melanoma antigen mutant B-Raf or its phosphorylated counterpart. Then, we assessed the presence and complexity of human MHC II-associated phosphopeptides by analyzing 2 autologous pairs of melanoma and EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid lines. By using sequential affinity isolation, biochemical enrichment, mass spectrometric sequencing, and comparative analysis, a total of 175 HLA-DR-associated phosphopeptides were characterized. Many were derived from source proteins that may have roles in cancer development, growth, and metastasis. Most were expressed exclusively by either melanomas or transformed B cells, suggesting the potential to define cell type-specific phosphatome \"fingerprints.\" We then generated HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted CD4(+) T cells specific for a phospho-MART-1 peptide identified in both melanoma cell lines.

RATIONALE: Despite advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification, effective phosphopeptide enrichment is a prerequisite towards comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis. Based on the different binding affinities and coordination geometries of the Ti(4+) and Fe(3+) ions with the phosphate group, we report a complementary metal-directed immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) method to increase the identification coverage of a phosphoproteome. METHODS: Phosphopeptides from standard phosphoproteins and Raji B cells were enriched from Ti(4+)-IMAC and Fe(3+)-IMAC methods, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS and Orbitrap MS analysis. Optimal enrichment specificity was achieved by selection of acid structure/concentration and organic solvent to compete with non-phosphopeptides. The effect of the metal ion and the chelating compound was evaluated by the comparison of the characteristics of enriched phosphopeptides between Ti(4+)-IMAC, Fe(3+)-IMAC and TiO(2) methods. RESULTS: To address the low enrichment specificity of the Ti(4+)-IMAC method, a simple one-step acid/solvent controlled IMAC method was developed with significantly improved specificity (88%) and recovery (93%). The most striking discovery is that the optimal Ti(4+)-IMAC and Fe(3+)-IMAC methods have low overlapping percentage (10%) among the 2905 enriched phosphopeptides from Raji cells, comprised of the distinct characteristics including hydrophobicity, amino acid compositions, and frequency of multiple phosphorylation of the phosphopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: The reported Fe(3+)-IMAC and Ti(4+)-IMAC methods can complementarily enrich acidic and basic phosphopeptides to effectively increase the identification coverage of an heterogeneous phosphoproteome (twice than the single approach).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3K) plays a central part in the mediation of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. No genetic studies of this enzyme in human syndromes of severe insulin resistance have been previously reported. METHODS: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 alpha regulatory subunit cDNA was examined in 20 subjects with syndromes of severe insulin resistance by single strand conformational polymorphism and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity and recruitment into phosphotyrosine complexes of variants of p85 alpha were studied in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Phosphopeptide binding characteristics of wild-type and mutant p85 alpha-GST fusion proteins were examined by surface plasmon resonance. RESULTS: The common p85 alpha variant, Met326I1e, was identified in 9 of the 20 subjects. Functional studies of the Met326Ile variant showed it to have equivalent insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity and phosphotyrosine recruitment as wild-type p85 alpha. A novel heterozygous mutation, Arg409Gln, was detected in one subject. Within the proband's family, carriers of the mutation had a higher median fasting plasma insulin (218 pmol/l) compared with wild-type relatives (72 mol/l) (n = 8 subjects, p = 0.06). The Arg409Gln p85 alpha subunit was associated with lower insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity compared with wild-type (mean reduction 15%, p < 0.05, n = 5). The recruitment of Arg409Gln p85 alpha into phosphotyrosine complexes was not significantly impaired. GST fusion proteins of wild-type and mutant p85 alpha showed identical binding to phosphopeptides in surface plasmon resonance studies. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in p85 alpha are uncommon in subjects with syndromes of severe insulin resistance. The Met326Ile p85 alpha variant appears to have no functional effect on the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. The impaired phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity of the Arg409Gln mutant suggests that it could contribute to the insulin resistance seen in this family.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 162, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 291, "charStart": 164}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 404, "charStart": 293}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 645, "charStart": 406}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 825, "charStart": 647}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 962, "charStart": 827}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1052, "charStart": 964}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1222, "charStart": 1054}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1293, "charStart": 1224}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1476, "charStart": 1295}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1651, "charStart": 1478}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1753, "charStart": 1653}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1889, "charStart": 1755}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2009, "charStart": 1891}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2140, "charStart": 2011}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2293, "charStart": 2142}], "mesh": ["Adult", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line", "Fasting", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Pedigree", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phosphorylation", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Signal Transduction", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The Shc PI domain binding specificity is dependent on residues lying amino-terminal to the phosphotyrosine rather than carboxyl-terminal as is seen with SH2 domains.

The defining structural feature of all of the caseins is their common phosphorylation sequence. In milk, these phosphoserine residues combine with inorganic calcium and phosphate to form colloidal complexes. In addition, nutritional benefits have been ascribed to the phosphopeptides from casein. To obtain a molecular basis for the functional, chemical, and biochemical properties of these casein peptides, the secondary structure of the phosphopeptide of bovine beta-casein (1-25) was reexamined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Both methods predict secondary structures for the peptide which include polyproline II elements as well as beta-extended sheet and turn-like elements. These structural elements were highly stable from 5 degrees to 70 degrees C. Reexamination of previously published 1H NMR data using chemical shift indices suggests structures in accord with the CD and FTIR data. Dephosphorylation showed little or no secondary structural changes, as monitored by CD and FTIR, but the modified peptide demonstrated pronounced self-association. The polymers formed were not highly temperature sensitive, but were pressure sensitive as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation at selected rotor speeds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated relatively large volume changes for the dephosphorylated peptide, in accord with the pressure dependent aggregation observed in the analytical ultracentrifuge data.

The local specificity determinants for a T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) have been inspected with the aid of a series of synthetic peptides, either enzymically or chemically phosphorylated, derived from the phosphoacceptor sites of phosphotyrosyl proteins. The truncated form of T-cell PTP, deprived of its C-terminal down-regulatory domain, readily dephosphorylates submicromolar concentrations of eptapeptides to eicosapeptides, reproducing the C-terminal down-regulatory site of pp60c-src (Tyr527), the phosphorylated loop IV of calmodulin and the main autophosphorylation site of two protein tyrosine kinases of the src family (Tyr416 of pp60c-src and Tyr412 of p51fgr). However, phosphopeptides of similar size, derived from phosphoacceptor tyrosyl sites of the abl and epidermal-growth-factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases, the phosphorylated loop III of calmodulin, and phosphoangiotensin II undergo either very slow or undetectable dephosphorylation, even if tested up to 1 microM concentration. The replacement of either Ser-P or O-methylated phosphotyrosine for phosphotyrosine within suitable peptide substrates gives rise to totally inert derivatives. Moreover, amino acid substitutions around phosphotyrosine in the peptides src(412-418), src(414-418) and abl-(390-397) deeply influence the dephosphorylation efficiency. From these data and from a comparative analysis of efficient versus poor phosphopeptide substrates, it can be concluded that acidic residues located on the N-terminal side of phosphotyrosine, with special reference to position -3, play a crucial role in substrate recognition, while basic residues in the same positions act as negative determinants. In any event, the presence of at least two aminoacyl residues upstream of phosphotyrosine represents a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for detectable dephosphorylation to occur. By replacing the truncated form of TC-PTP with the full length TC-PTP, the dephosphorylation efficiencies of all peptides tested are dramatically impaired. Such an effect is invariably accounted for by a substantial increase in Km values, accompanied by a more or less pronounced decrease in Vmax values.

Activation of cyclic nucleotide dependent signaling pathways leads to relaxation of smooth muscle, alterations in the cytoskeleton of cultured cells, and increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20. To determine the effects of phosphorylated HSP20 on the actin cytoskeleton, phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 were synthesized. These peptides contained 1) the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site of HSP20, 2) a phosphoserine, and 3) a protein transduction domain. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 led to loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, interference reflection microscopy, and biochemical quantitation of globular-actin. Treatment with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 also led to dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin. Pull-down assays demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins associated with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 (but not peptide analogs in which the serine was not phosphorylated). The binding of 14-3-3 protein to phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 prevented the association of cofilin with 14-3-3. These data suggest that HSP20 may modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics by competing with the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin for binding to the scaffolding protein 14-3-3.

Using several synthetic peptides, we have demonstrated that Hck and Src recognize similar structural features in the substrate peptides, suggesting that both kinases have the intrinsic ability to carry out overlapping cellular functions by phosphorylating similar cellular proteins in vivo. Using a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide that has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Src family kinases with high affinity, we found that although Src could bind to the phosphopeptide, Hck showed no interaction. The inability of Hck to bind the phosphopeptide was not a result of a stable intramolecular interaction between its SH2 domain and C-terminal regulatory phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr-520), as most Hck molecules in the purified Hck preparation were not tyrosine-phosphorylated. In contrast to intact Hck, a recombinant truncation analog of Hck was able to bind the phosphopeptide with an affinity similar to that of the Src SH2 domain, suggesting that conformational constraints are imposed on intact Hck that limit accessibility of its SH2 domain to the phosphopeptide. Furthermore, the difference in SH2 domain accessibility is a potential mechanism that enables Src and Hck to perform their respective unique functions by 1) targeting them to different subcellular compartments, whereupon they phosphorylate different cellular proteins, and/or 2) facilitating direct binding to their cellular substrates.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 176, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 391, "charStart": 178}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 603, "charStart": 393}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 894, "charStart": 605}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1121, "charStart": 896}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1397, "charStart": 1123}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1690, "charStart": 1399}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 2027, "charStart": 1692}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Chromatography, Ion Exchange", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Recombinant Proteins", "Subcellular Fractions", "Substrate Specificity", "Tyrosine", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Two site-specific antibodies have been prepared by immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides derived from the partial cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), which has been proposed to encode the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) kinase (Boulton, T. G., Yancopoulos, G. D., Gregory, J. S., Slauer, C., Moomaw, C., Hsu, J., and Cobb, M. H. (1990) Science 249, 64-67). With immunoprecipitation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Western blotting, an antibody to the peptide containing triple tyrosine residues (alpha Y91) resembling one of the insulin receptor autophosphorylation sites specifically recognized 42- and 44-kDa proteins. On the other hand, an antibody to the peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus portions (alpha C92) of the ERK1 cDNA gene product recognized the 44-kDa protein much more efficiently than the 42-kDa protein. With immunoprecipitation in the absence of SDS, alpha Y91 could barely recognize these two proteins and alpha C92 recognized the 44-kDa protein but failed to recognize the 42-kDa protein. Kinase assays in myelin basic protein (MBP)-containing gel, after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that insulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha Y91 immunoprecipitates comigrated at molecular mass 42 and 44 kDa. On the other hand, the stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha C92 immunoprecipitates comigrated only at molecular mass 44 kDa. Insulin stimulated the MBP kinase activity in gels and phosphorylation of these two proteins by greater than 10-fold with a maximal level at 5 min. Insulin and TPA rapidly stimulate the phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins via de novo threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.

RATIONALE: Radical-directed dissociation techniques provide structural information which is complementary to that from conventional collision-induced dissociation (CID). The analysis of phosphopeptide anions is warranted due to their relatively acidic character. As femtosecond laser-induced ionization/dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (fsLID-MS/MS) is uniquely initiated by field ionization, an investigation is warranted to determine whether fsLID may provide novel analytical utility for phosphopeptide anions. METHODS: Twenty-three synthetic deprotonated phosphopeptide anions were introduced into a three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization. The ion trap was interfaced with a near-IR (802\u2009nm) ultrashort-pulsed (35\u2009fs FWHM) ultrahigh-powered (peak power ~10(14) \u2009W/cm(2)) laser system. Performance comparisons are made with other techniques applied to phosphopeptide anion analysis, including CID, electron detachment dissociation (EDD), negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD), activated electron photodetachment dissociation (activated-EPD), and ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD). RESULTS: FsLID-MS/MS of multiply deprotonated phosphopeptide anions provides sequence information via phosphorylation-intact a/x ions in addition to other sequence ions, satellite ions, and side-chain losses. Novel fragmentation processes include selective c-ion formation N-terminal to Ser/Thr and a phosphorylation-specific correlation between xn -98 ion abundances and phosphorylation at the n(th) residue. Sequencing-quality data required about 30\u2009s of signal averaging. fsLID-MS/MS of singly deprotonated phosphopeptides did not yield product anions with stable trajectories, despite significant depletion of the precursor. CONCLUSIONS: Multiply deprotonated phosphopeptide anions were sequenced via negative-mode fsLID-MS/MS, with phosphosite localization facilitated by a/x ion series in addition to diagnostic x(n)-98 ions. fsLID-MS/MS is qualitatively competitive with other techniques.

We report here that angiotensin II, working through the AT1 receptor subtype, stimulates the phosphorylation of Nck in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis revealed that Nck is phosphorylated on four peptides containing exclusively phosphoserine in quiescent cells. Treatment with angiotensin II resulted in increased phosphorylation of these four peptides, without the appearance of new phosphopeptides.

Notably, the phosphorylation of these Nck-binding proteins was found to increase in parallel with that of Nck on stimulation by angiotensin II. One candidate for the 66 kDa phosphoprotein is the serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), which was found to form a stable complex with Nck in aortic smooth muscle cells. We have also identified the gamma2 isoform of casein kinase I as another protein kinase that associates with Nck in these cells. These findings indicate that Nck is a target of G-protein-coupled receptors and suggest a role for Pak1 and casein kinase I-gamma2 in downstream signalling or regulation of the AT1 receptor.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 251, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 407, "charStart": 253}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 558, "charStart": 409}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 700, "charStart": 560}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 839, "charStart": 702}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 981, "charStart": 841}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1125, "charStart": 983}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1312, "charStart": 1127}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1441, "charStart": 1314}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1632, "charStart": 1443}], "mesh": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Casein Kinases", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Oncogene Proteins", "Peptide Mapping", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Protein Binding", "Protein Kinases", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rats", "Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1", "Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2", "Receptors, Angiotensin", "Signal Transduction", "p21-Activated Kinases", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Several tumor lines of neuronal origin were assayed for the presence of two forms of pp60c-src, designated pp60 and pp60+. To determine the specific kinase activity of pp60 and pp60+, an enzymatic analysis was carried out with neuroblastoma LA-N-5, containing a high level of pp60+, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, containing a low level of pp60+, fibroblast FSD, containing pp60 but no pp60+, and Rous sarcoma virus transformed 3T3 cells, SR-3T3, containing pp60v-src. Km values for Mg2+-ATP of approximately 21, 8, 17 and 13 microM were determined for pp60src kinase from LA-N-5, SK-N-SH, FSD and SR-3T3 respectively, using enolase as a substrate. The Vmax values for pp60c-src kinase from LA-N-5, SK-N-SH and FSD were similar. The Vmax value of pp60v-src was about 50-fold higher. Thirteen distinct phosphopeptides were found in tryptic digests from pp60 and pp60+ labeled in vivo with [32P]. The presence of one phosphopeptide, derived from the N-terminus, correlated with the level of pp60+ in neuroblastoma cells, but a small amount of this peptide was also detected in fibroblasts. Only phosphoserine was detected in the N-terminus of pp60 and pp60+.

The pleiotropic function of p53 is believed to be greatly influenced by phosphorylation, and several sites on p53 are known to be targets for distinct protein kinases. In this study, we observed that affinity-purified p53 from overexpressing cells was phosphorylated by a co-purified protein kinase in vitro. To identify phosphorylation site(s), the resulting phosphorylated p53 protein was subjected to primary and secondary proteolytic cleavage, and phosphopeptides were fractionated by a two-dimensional peptide gel system. Phosphoamino acid analysis and manual Edman degradation of the isolated phosphopeptides enabled us to unequivocally identify Thr-55 as the major phosphorylation site on p53. Furthermore, comparative phosphopeptide mapping data suggest that DNA-PK is not the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation.
