Reversible protein phosphorylation ranks among the most important post-translational modifications, and elucidation of phosphorylation sites is essential to understand the regulation of key cellular processes such as signal transduction. Enrichment of phosphorylated peptides is a prerequisite for successful analysis due to their low stoichiometry, heterogeneity, and low abundance. Enrichment is often performed manually, which is inherently labor-intensive and a major hindrance in large-scale analyses. Automation of the enrichment method would vastly improve reproducibility and thereby facilitate 'high-throughput' phosphoproteomics research. Here, we describe a robust and automated online TiO 2-based two-dimensional chromatographic approach to selectively enrich phosphorylated peptides from digests of complete cellular lysates. We demonstrate method enhancement for both adsorption and desorption of phosphorylated peptides resulting in lower limits of detection. Phosphorylated peptides from a mere 500 attomole tryptic digest of a protein mixture were easily detected. With the combination of strong cation exchange chromatography with the online TiO 2 enrichment, 2152 phosphopeptides were enriched from 250 microg of protein originating for the cell lysate of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. This is a 4-fold improvement when compared to an enrichment strategy based solely on strong cation exchange/LC-MS. Phosphopeptide enrichment methods are intrinsically biased against relatively basic phosphopeptides. Analysis of the p I distributions of the enriched/detected phosphopeptides showed that the p I profile resembles that of a total Drosophila protein digest, revealing that the current described online procedure does not discriminate against either more acidic or basic phosphopeptides. However, careful comparison of our new and existing phosphopeptide enrichment techniques also reveal that, like many enrichment techniques, we are still far from comprehensive phosphoproteomics analyses, and we describe several factors that still require to be addressed.

Large-scale phosphoproteomics studies are of great interest due to their potential for the dissection of signaling pathways controlled by protein kinases. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomic techniques offer new opportunities to profile protein kinase activities in a comprehensive manner. However, this increasingly used approach still poses many analytical challenges. On one hand, high stringency criteria for phosphopeptide identification based on MS/MS data are needed in order to avoid false positives; however, on the other hand, these stringent criteria also result in the introduction of many false negatives. In the current report, we employ different mass spectrometric techniques for large-scale phosphoproteomics in order to reduce the presence of false negatives and enhance data confidence. A LTQ-Orbitrap LC-MS/MS platform identified approximately 3 times more phosphopeptides than Q-TOF LC-MS/MS instrumentation (4308 versus 1485 identifications, respectively). In both cases, collision induced dissociation (CID) was used to fragment peptides. Interestingly, the two platforms produced complementary data as many of the low scoring phosphopeptide ions identified by LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS gave rise to high score identifications by Q-TOF MS/MS analysis, and vice versa. In fact, approximately 450 phosphopeptides identified by the Q-TOF instrument were not identified by the LTQ-Orbitrap. Further data comparison revealed the extent of the problem: in one experiment, the estimated number of false negatives (1066) was close to the number of identified phosphopeptides (1485).

The rapidly growing field of phosphoproteomics has led to a strong demand for procedures enabling fast and reliable isolation and enrichment of phosphorylated proteins and peptides. During the past decade, several novel phosphopeptide enrichment methods based on the affinity of phosphoryl groups for titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) have been developed and tested. The ultimate goal of obtaining comprehensive phosphoproteomes has, however, been found difficult to achieve and the obtained results often vary, dependent on the enrichment method and protocol used.

Special emphasis is put on the effect of the degree of phosphorylation of the phosphopeptide, the impact of the primary amino acid structure, and the role of electrostatic interactions. The results show that, in general, adsorption of phosphopeptides follows the Langmuir model and that the affinity for the TiO(2) surface increases in a nonlinear fashion with increasing degree of phosphorylation. An exception was detected, however, where positive cooperativity between the peptides existed and the Langmuir model no longer applied. The source behind the cooperativity could be traced back to the primary amino acid structure and, more specifically, the presence of positively charged amino acids in positions that enable electrostatic interaction with phosphoryl groups on neighboring peptides.

As a driver for many biological processes, phosphorylation remains an area of intense research interest. Advances in multiplexed quantitation utilizing isobaric tags (e.g., TMT and iTRAQ) have the potential to create a new paradigm in quantitative proteomics. New instrumentation and software are propelling these multiplexed workflows forward, which results in more accurate, sensitive, and reproducible quantitation across tens of thousands of phosphopeptides. This study assesses the performance of multiplexed quantitative phosphoproteomics on the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. Utilizing a two-phosphoproteome model of precursor ion interference, we assessed the accuracy of phosphopeptide quantitation across a variety of experimental approaches. These methods included the use of synchronous precursor selection (SPS) to enhance TMT reporter ion intensity and accuracy. We found that (i) ratio distortion remained a problem for phosphopeptide analysis in multiplexed quantitative workflows, (ii) ratio distortion can be overcome by the use of an SPS-MS3 scan, (iii) interfering ions generally possessed a different charge state than the target precursor, and (iv) selecting only the phosphate neutral loss peak (single notch) for the MS3 scan still provided accurate ratio measurements. Remarkably, these data suggest that the underlying cause of interference may not be due to coeluting and cofragmented peptides but instead from consistent, low level background fragmentation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept 10-plex experiment, we compared phosphopeptide levels from five murine brains to five livers.

However, the P-O stretch (9.6-11 mum or 1042-909 cm-1) of this posttranslational modification is in direct resonance with the CO2 IR laser (10.6 mum or 943 cm-1) used for IRMPD. Therefore, the vibrational frequency of the phosphate moiety may be an additional factor in the rapid first-order decay of phosphopeptides.

Although advances in MS control have enabled the high-throughput discovery of proteins from limited amounts of sample, automated selection of MS/MS precursor ions based on intensity alone can significantly hamper the detection of low-abundance phosphopeptides. On the basis of the observation that the introduction of a phosphate moiety does not dramatically change peptide retention time in reverse-phase chromatography, phosphopeptide specific MS/MS fragmentation attempts based on LC retention time and m/z were evaluated using a standard protein mixture, then using in vitro phosphorylated myelin basic protein.

In the current study, we found that the peptide-to-TiO(2) beads ratio was a significant factor for phosphopeptide enrichment, and insufficient or excessive beads could decrease the selectivity.

Furthermore, the number of multiply phosphorylated peptides that are identified in most published studies is rather low. Here the protocol for a new strategy that separates mono-phosphorylated pep-tides from multiply phosphorylated peptides using sequential elution from immobilized metal affinity chromatography is described. The two separate phosphopeptide fractions are subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometric methods optimized for mono-phosphorylated and multiply phosphorylated peptides, respectively, resulting in improved identification of especially multiply phosphorylated peptides from a minimum amount of starting material. The new method increases the coverage of the phosphoproteome significantly.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 143, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 320, "charStart": 145}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 538, "charStart": 322}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 659, "charStart": 540}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 865, "charStart": 661}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1177, "charStart": 867}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1253, "charStart": 1179}], "mesh": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Chromatography, Affinity", "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques", "Humans", "Mass Spectrometry", "Metals", "Models, Biological", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}

{"text": "Combining Homologous Recombination and Phosphopeptide-binding Data to Predict the Impact of BRCA1 BRCT Variants on Cancer Risk. BRCA1 mutations have been identified that increase the risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Genetic screening is now offered to patients with a family history of cancer, to adapt their treatment and the management of their relatives. However, a large number of BRCA1 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are detected. To better understand the significance of these variants, a high-throughput structural and functional analysis was performed on a large set of BRCA1 VUS. Information on both cellular localization and homology-directed DNA repair (HR) capacity was obtained for 78 BRCT missense variants in the UMD-BRCA1 database and measurement of the structural stability and phosphopeptide-binding capacities was performed for 42 mutated BRCT domains. This extensive and systematic analysis revealed that most characterized causal variants affect BRCT-domain solubility in bacteria and all impair BRCA1 HR activity in cells. Furthermore, binding to a set of 5 different phosphopeptides was tested: all causal variants showed phosphopeptide-binding defects and no neutral variant showed such defects. A classification is presented on the basis of mutated BRCT domain solubility, phosphopeptide-binding properties, and VUS HR capacity. These data suggest that HR-defective variants, which present, in addition, BRCT domains either insoluble in bacteria or defective for phosphopeptide binding, lead to an increased cancer risk. Furthermore, the data suggest that variants with a WT HR activity and whose BRCT domains bind with a WT affinity to the 5 phosphopeptides are neutral. The case of variants with WT HR activity and defective phosphopeptide binding should be further characterized, as this last functional defect might be sufficient per se to lead to tumorigenesis.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors are partially purified from human placenta by sequential affinity chromatography with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and agarose derivatized with an IGF-I analog. Adsorption specificity to this affinity matrix demonstrates that low coupling ratios of IGF-I analog to agarose yield preparations that are highly selective in purifying IGF-I receptor with minimal cross-contamination by the insulin receptor present in the same placental extracts. Incubation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with [gamma-32P]ATP results in a marked phosphorylation of the receptor beta subunits, which appear as a doublet of Mr = 93,000 and 95,000 upon electrophoresis on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 32P-labeled receptor beta subunit doublet contains predominantly phosphotyrosine and to a much lesser extent phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation exhibits tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous histone. The characteristics of the IGF-I receptor-associated tyrosine kinase are remarkably similar to those of the insulin receptor kinase. Thus, prior phosphorylation of the immobilized IGF-I receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP results in a progressive activation of the receptor-associated histone kinase activity. A maximal (10-fold) activation is achieved between 0.25 and 1 mM ATP. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximal (30 microM) activation of the IGF-I receptor kinase is similar to that of the insulin receptor kinase.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor beta subunit doublet is enhanced by 7-8-fold when reductant is included in the reaction medium, as is observed for the insulin receptor kinase. Significantly, the dose responses of both receptor types to reductant are identical.

In this work we have studied the stoichiometry of receptor phosphorylation and have utilized one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping after cyanogen bromide cleavage to demonstrate that the third intracellular loop is the predominant domain of phosphorylation of this receptor in response to these treatments. Of the average 5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor, greater than 95% was on the third loop, with the remainder residing on the carboxyl-terminal tail.

Activation of phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in endothelial cells in part is responsible for angiogenesis in vivo. The cellular mechanisms exerting negative control over PLCgamma1 activation, however, remain unaddressed. Here by using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we show that the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutively associates with PLCgamma1 via its C-terminal domain and conditionally interacts with VEGFR-2 via the N-terminal/TKB domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of VEGFR-2 showed that full activation of c-Cbl requires its direct association with phospho-tyrosines 1052 and 1057 of VEGFR-2 via its TKB domain and indirect association with phospho-tyrosine 1173 of VEGFR-2 via PLCgamma1. The tertiary complex formation between VEGFR-2, PLCgamma1 and c-Cbl selectively promotes ubiquitylation and suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma1 by a proteolysis-independent mechanism. Further analysis showed that association of c-Cbl with VEGFR-2 does not impact ubiquitylation, down-regulation, or tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Silencing of c-Cbl by siRNA revealed that endogenous c-Cbl plays an inhibitory role in angiogenesis.

The work describes the development of an enrichment method for the analysis of endogenous phosphopeptides in serum.

In this context, blood is one of the most useful biofluids for screening, but a systematic investigation of the endogenous peptides, especially phosphorylated ones, is still lacking, mainly due to the lack of suitable analytical methods. Thus, in this paper, different phosphopeptide enrichment strategies were pursued, based either on metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC, in the form of commercial TiO2 spin columns or magnetic graphitized carbon black-TiO2 composite), or on immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC, in the form of Ti4+-IMAC magnetic material or commercial Fe3+-IMAC spin columns). While MOAC strategies proved completely unsuccessful, probably due to interfering phospholipids displacing phosphopeptides, the IMAC materials performed very well. Different sample preparation strategies were tested, comprising direct dilution with the loading buffer, organic solvent precipitation, and lipid removal from the matrix, as well as the addition of phosphatase inhibitors during sample handling for maximized endogenous phosphopeptide enrichment. All data were acquired by a shotgun peptidomics approach, in which peptide samples were separated by reversed-phase nanoHPLC hyphenated with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry.

Several studies have indicated that prolactin (PRL) assumes oligomeric, proteolytically cleaved, phosphorylated and glycosylated forms.

In the present study, we examined whether or not PRL is present in the mouse pituitary gland in the phosphorylated form. Mouse pituitary PRL was digested with acid phosphatase, resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and then immunoblotted against the anti-PRL, anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. We also examined whether PRL is phosphorylated by protein kinases and semi-quantified the ratios of PPRL to PRL in the pituitary gland. The results indicated that three types of PRL are present in the pituitary glands of both male and female mice.

The propagation of phosphorylation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is a key dynamic cellular event involved in signal transduction, which is often deregulated in disease states such as cancer. Probing phosphorylation dynamics is therefore crucial for understanding receptor tyrosine kinases' function and finding ways to inhibit their effects. MS methods combined with metabolic labeling such as stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) have already proven successful in deciphering temporal phosphotyrosine perturbations. However, they are limited in terms of multiplexing, and they also are time consuming, because several experiments need to be performed separately. Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on 5-plex SILAC that allows monitoring of phosphotyrosine signaling perturbations induced by a drug treatment in one single experiment. Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318 unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast cancer cell line model. Hierarchical clustering of the time profiles followed by pathway enrichment analysis highlighted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2 signaling as the major pathways affected by erlotinib, thereby validating the method. Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to those of other proteins in the ErbB pathways, the phosphorylation at Tyr453 of protein FAM59A, a recently described adaptor of EGFR, was confirmed as tightly involved in the signaling cascade. The present investigation also demonstrates the remote effect of EGFR inhibition on ErbB3 phosphorylation sites such as Tyr1289 and Tyr1328, as well as a potential feedback effect on Tyr877 of ErbB2.

{"text": "Discovering and validating unknown phospho-sites from p38 and HuR protein kinases in vitro by Phosphoproteomic and Bioinformatic tools. BACKGROUND: The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are known to be deregulated in many human malignancies. Phosphopeptide identification of protein-kinases and site determination are major challenges in biomedical mass spectrometry (MS). P38 and HuR protein kinases have been reported extensively in the general principles of signalling pathways modulated by phosphorylation, mainly by molecular biology and western blotting techniques. Thus, although it has been demonstrated they are phosphorylated in different stress/stimuli conditions, the phosphopeptides and specific amino acids in which the phosphate groups are located in those protein kinases have not been shown completely. METHODS: We have combined different resins: (a) IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Capture), (b) TiO2 (Titanium dioxide) and (c) SIMAC (Sequential Elution from IMAC) to isolate phosphopeptides from p38 and HuR protein kinases in vitro.Different phosphopeptide MS strategies were carried out by the LTQ ion Trap mass spectrometer (Thermo): (a) Multistage activation (MSA) and (b) Neutral loss MS3 (DDNLMS3).In addition, Molecular Dynamics (MD) bioinformatic simulation has been applied in order to simulate, over a period of time, the effects of the presence of the extra phosphate group (and the associated negative charge) in the overall structure and behaviour of the protein HuR.This study is supported by the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent ethical guidelines. RESULTS: The combination of these techniques allowed for:(1) The identification of 6 unknown phosphopeptides of these protein kinases. (2) Amino acid site assignments of the phosphate groups from each identified phosphopeptide, including manual validation by inspection of all the spectra. (3) The analyses of the phosphopeptides discovered were carried out in four triplicate experiments to avoid false positives getting high reproducibility in all the isolated phosphopeptides recovered from both protein kinases. (4) Computer simulation using MD techniques allowed us to get functional models of both structure and interactions of the previously mentioned phosphorylated kinases and the differences between their phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated forms.

Evidence from electrophysiological and ion flux studies has established that dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels are subject to regulation by neurotransmitter-mediated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. In the present study, we have further characterized the phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a multifunctional Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase of the membrane-associated form of the 165-kDa polypeptide identified as the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor. The initial rates of phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by both protein kinases were found to be relatively good compared to the rates of phosphorylation of established substrates of the enzymes. Phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by both protein kinases was additive. Prior phosphorylation by either one of the kinases alone did not preclude phosphorylation by the second kinase. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated the 165-kDa peptide preferentially at serine residues, although a small amount of phosphothreonine was also formed. In contrast, after phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, slightly more phosphothreonine than phosphoserine was recovered. Phosphopeptide mapping indicated that the two kinases phosphorylated the peptide at distinct as well as similar sites. Notably, one major site phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was not phosphorylated by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, while other sites were phosphorylated to a high degree by the Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, but to a much lesser degree by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results show that the 165-kDa dihydropyridine receptor from skeletal muscle can be multiply phosphorylated at distinct sites by the cAMP- and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. As the 165-kDa peptide may be the major functional unit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channel, the results suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent modulation of Ca channel activity by neurotransmitters may involve phosphorylation of the 165-kDa peptide at multiple sites.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 119, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 343, "charStart": 121}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 628, "charStart": 345}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 828, "charStart": 630}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 905, "charStart": 830}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1017, "charStart": 907}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1182, "charStart": 1019}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1352, "charStart": 1184}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1471, "charStart": 1354}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1785, "charStart": 1473}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1972, "charStart": 1787}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2253, "charStart": 1974}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Calcium Channels", "Dihydropyridines", "In Vitro Techniques", "Muscles", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Rabbits", "Receptors, Nicotinic"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

We have investigated the role of phosphorylation of the capsid protein of the avian hepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus in viral replication. We found previously that three serines and one threonine in the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the capsid protein serve as phosphorylation sites and that the pattern of phosphorylation at these sites in intracellular viral capsids is complex. In this study, we present evidence that the phosphorylation state of three of these residues affects distinct steps in viral replication. By substituting these residues with alanine in order to mimic serine, or with aspartic acid in order to mimic phosphoserine, and assaying the effects of these substitutions on various steps in virus replication, we were able to make the following inferences. (i) The presence of phosphoserines at residues 245 and 259 stimulates DNA synthesis within viral nucleocapsids. (ii) The absence of phosphoserine at residue 257 and at residues 257 and 259 stimulates covalently closed circular DNA synthesis and virus production, respectively. (iii) The presence of phosphoserine at position 259 is required for initiation of infection. The results implied that both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated capsid proteins were necessary for a nucleocapsid particle to carry out all its functions in virus replication, explaining why differential phosphorylation of the capsid protein occurs in hepadnaviruses. Whether these differentially phosphorylated proteins coexist on the same nucleocapsid, or whether the nucleocapsid acquires sequential functions through selective phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, is discussed.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 90, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 232, "charStart": 92}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 473, "charStart": 234}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 611, "charStart": 475}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 870, "charStart": 613}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 982, "charStart": 872}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1147, "charStart": 984}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1240, "charStart": 1149}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1511, "charStart": 1242}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1727, "charStart": 1513}], "mesh": ["Alanine", "Amino Acids", "Animals", "Capsid", "Chickens", "DNA, Viral", "Genome, Viral", "Hepatitis B Virus, Duck", "Mutation", "Phosphorylation", "Transfection", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Virus Replication"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The final enzyme preparation exhibited a broad pH optimum of 5.6-6.6 and could dephosphorylate both L and D enantiomers of the phosphoserine, but with different Km values for O-P-L serine (3.6 x 10(-5) M) and O-P-D serine (1 x 10(-4) M). Enzyme activity was found to be specific for phosphoserine, whereas other phosphoesters including phosphothreonine and phosphoproteins such as casein and phosvitin were found to be poor substrates. The enzyme activity was uncompetitively inhibited by L-serine. Further the PSPase activity was inhi
