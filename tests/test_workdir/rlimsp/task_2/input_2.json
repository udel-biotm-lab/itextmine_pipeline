An analysis of the nucleoprotein (NP) of 29 different influenza A viruses by phosphopeptide fingerprinting revealed three prototype patterns. The first, which was a complex pattern consisting of six to seven phosphopeptides, another which was relatively simple consisted of two or three phosphopeptides, and a third one which was complex but was missing the main phosphopeptide shared by the two other patterns. Phosphoserine was the only labelled phosphamino acid detected. A tentative deduction of two of the phosphate attachment sites (serine residues at positions 3 and 473) could be made by comparison of the known amino acid sequences of the NPs of 25 strains. No correlation was found between species specificity or subtype or year of isolation of the strains. During the infectious cycle the fingerprint underwent significant changes, indicating subtle phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the NP at various stages during viral multiplication. Most of the phosphopeptides were metabolically stable; however one major phosphopeptide, which was not found in the NP of mature virions, exhibited a high turnover (presumably serine at position 3). The phosphopeptide fingerprint could be significantly influenced in vivo by the specific stimulation of cellular protein kinase C by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or by its inhibition with the isoquinoline sulphonamide H7.H7 specifically inhibited the replication of influenza A viruses by deregulation of viral protein synthesis without interfering with the multiplication of a parainfluenza virus (Newcastle disease virus), an alphavirus (Semliki Forest virus) or a flavivirus (West Nile).

The cognitive impairment in patients with AD is closely associated with loss of synapses and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus. Effective treatment for AD is still not available. In this study, the sequence comprising of residues 50-71 in the N-terminal region of tau, containing theoretically predicted B- and T-cell epitopes in close proximity to pathologically relevant phospho-serine (residue 68) and phospho-threonine (residues 69, 71) was selected as a potential immunotherapeutic peptide.

The first method of isotopic substitution of a nonbridging oxygen atom in pre-existing phosphates on peptides is reported, solving a long-standing, challenging issue in the sample preparation of phosphopeptides. Peptidyl phosphates, phosphate groups on phosphopeptides, are converted to phosphoramidates with carbodiimide assistance. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the newly formed phosphoramidates incorporates one oxygen atom from H2(16)O or H2(18)O, producing peptidyl phosphates-16O1 or -18O1, respectively. The oxygen labels are stable under common separation and analysis conditions. This labeling method causes minimal structural alteration to peptidyl phosphates and allows the direct application of established phosphate-specific marker ions to the mass spectrometric analysis of differentially labeled phosphopeptide pairs. Using phosphotyrosinyl peptides as model analytes, the characteristic 16O1- and 18O1-labeled phosphotyrosine immonium ions at m/z 216.043 and 218.047 are used for developing a method of phosphopeptide quantitation that is independent of the amino acid sequence of the peptides.

The [32P]phosphate content of the IGF-II receptors, immunoprecipitated from extracts of H-35 cell monolayers previously incubated with [32P]phosphate for 24 h, was decreased after brief exposure of the cells to insulin. Analysis of tryptic digests of labeled IGF-II receptors by bidimensional peptide mapping revealed that the decrease in the content of [32P]phosphate occurred to varying degrees on three tryptic phosphopeptides. Thin layer electrophoresis of an acid hydrolysate of isolated IGF-II receptors revealed the presence of [32P] phosphoserine and [32P]phosphothreonine. Insulin treatment of cells caused a decrease in the labeled phosphoserine and phosphothreonine content of IGF-II receptors. The ability of a number of highly purified protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, phosphorylase kinase, and casein kinase II) to catalyze the phosphorylation of purified IGF-II receptors was examined.

To continue exploring the role of the SH2 domain in pp60v-src-mediated transformation, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create mutant v-src alleles predicted to encode proteins with overall structural integrity intact but with reduced ability to bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Arginine-175, which makes critical contacts in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket, was mutated to lysine or alanine. Unexpectedly, both mutations created v-src alleles that transform chicken cells with wild-type (wt) efficiency and are reduced for transformation of rat cells; these alleles are host dependent for transformation. Additionally, these alleles resulted in a round morphological transformation of chicken cells, unlike 12 of the 13 known host-dependent src SH2 mutations that result in a fusiform morphology. Analysis of phosphopeptide binding by the mutant SH2 domains reveal that the in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a high affinity for wt src SH2 correlates with wt (round) morphological transformation in chicken cells and in vitro ability to bind phosphopeptides known to have a low affinity for wt src SH2 correlates with rat cell transformation.

Phosphoproteomics has become an important dimension in systems biology studies, and it is essential to have efficient analytical tools to cover a broad range of signaling events. To evaluate current mass spectrometric performance, we present here a novel method to estimate the efficiency of phosphopeptide identification by tandem mass spectrometry. Phosphopeptides were directly isolated from whole plant cell extracts, dephosphorylated, and then incubated with one of three purified kinases-casein kinase II, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, and SNF-related protein kinase 2.6-along with 16O4- and 18O4-ATP separately for in vitro kinase reactions. Phosphopeptides were enriched and analyzed by LC-MS. The phosphopeptide identification rate was estimated by comparing phosphopeptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry with phosphopeptide pairs generated by stable isotope labeled kinase reactions. Overall, we found that current high speed and high accuracy mass spectrometers can only identify 20%-40% of total phosphopeptides primarily due to relatively poor fragmentation, additional modifications, and low abundance, highlighting the urgent need for continuous efforts to improve phosphopeptide identification efficiency.

This promiscuous recognition is of fundamental interest in chemistry and biology but is challenging when designing phosphopeptides in silico for cell biology studies. To investigate promiscuous recognition and binding processes of phosphopeptides and the modular domain, we selected a domain essential in breast cancer-the breast-cancer-associated protein 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal (BRCT) repeats as our model system. We performed molecular dynamics simulations and detailed analyses of the dihedral space to study protein fluctuation and conformational changes with phosphopeptide binding. We also studied the association processes of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides using Brownian dynamics with a coarse-grained model. We found that the BRCT domain is preorganized for phosphopeptide binding but has a moderate arrangement of side chains to form complexes with various types of phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide binding restricts the system motion in general, while the nonpolar phosphopeptide becomes more flexible in the bound state. Our analysis found that the BRCT domain utilizes different mechanisms, usually termed lock and key, induced-fit, and population-shift/conformational-selection models, to recognize peptides with different features.

Formation of S-carbamidomethylmethionine (camMet) occurs as a side reaction during cysteine alkylation with iodoacetamide (IAA). In collision-induced dissociation, peptides with camMet show an abundant neutral loss of 2-(methylthio)acetamide (C3H7NOS = 105.025 Da) at moderate collision offset values which are similar to those optimal for loss of phosphoric acid (H3PO4 = 97.977 Da). Neutral loss analysis is used for spotting of phosphopeptides which contain phosphoserine (pSer) or phosphothreonine (pThr) residues. In the case where precursor ions cannot be accurately assigned in the survey spectrum (e.g. due to low ion abundance or signal overlap), the mass accuracy of a neutral loss tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis depends on the precursor ion isolation window. For the charge states 2+, 3+ or 4+, a typical 3.5 Da precursor isolation window results in neutral loss windows of 7, 10.5 or 14 Da, respectively. Consequently, neutral loss of 105 Da from alkylated methionine residues can mimic the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-specific neutral loss of 98 Da. In the evaluation of quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) parent ion scan data for neutral loss of H3PO4, this interference was frequently observed. It is illustrated in this study using the analysis of ovalbumin phosphorylation as an example. The +80 Da molecular weight shift connected with phosphorylation at serine or threonine may also be mimicked by carbamidomethylation of methionine through a combination with sodium adduction (+57 Da +22 Da = +79 Da).

Signaling by tyrosine kinases involves direct associations between proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Specificity in signaling pathways results in part from inherent selectivity in interactions between particular SH2 domains and phosphopeptide sequences. The cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 (Syp, PTP 1D, PTP-2C) contains two SH2 domains (N and C) which mediate its association with and activation by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor receptors and IRS-1. We have developed a competitive phosphopeptide binding assay to analyze specificity of the SH-PTP2 N-SH2 domain for phosphorylation sites of these phosphoproteins. The sequence surrounding Tyr1009 bound with greatest affinity (ID50 = 14 microM) of eight PDGF receptor-derived phosphopeptides tested. No peptides corresponding to known epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation sites bound with high affinity. However, an alternative sequence surrounding Tyr954 bound tightly (ID50 = 21 microM). Of the 13 IRS-1-related peptides analyzed, sequences surrounding Tyr546, Tyr895, and Tyr1172 bound with highest affinity (ID50 = 11, 4, and 1 microM, respectively). Alternative phosphopeptides generally bound with much weaker affinity (ID50 > 150 microM). These findings are consistent with recent mutational analyses of the PDGF receptor and predict site-specific interactions between SH-PTP2 and each of these phosphoproteins. Comparisons between peptide sequences suggest that the N-terminal SH2 domain of SH-PTP2 binds with highest affinity to phosphotyrosine (pY) followed by a beta-branched residue (Val, Ile, Thr) at pY+1 and a hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, Ile) at pY+3 positions.

Tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) and N'[3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyl]-diethylenetriamine (TPDA) were used in a 1:1 mole ratio in the production of amine-functionalized sol-gels. The sol-gel network was then used for phosphopeptide enrichment.

Moreover, phosphopeptide enrichment was successfully performed using nonfat milk as a highly contaminated and complex material.

Immobilized metal affinity chromatography and titanium dioxide chromatography can greatly assist selective phosphopeptide enrichment.

Protein phosphorylation represents one of the key regulatory events in physiological insulin secretion from the islet beta-cell. In this context, several classes of protein kinases (e.g. calcium-, cyclic nucleotide- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinases and tyrosine kinases) have been characterized in the beta-cell. The majority of phosphorylated amino acids identified include phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine. Protein histidine phosphorylation has been implicated in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular signal transduction. Most notably, phoshohistidine accounts for 6% of total protein phosphorylation in eukaryotes, which makes it nearly 100-fold more abundant than phosphotyrosine, but less abundant than phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. However, very little is known about the number of proteins with phosphohistidines, since they are highly labile and are rapidly lost during phosphoamino acid identification under standard experimental conditions. The overall objectives of this review are to: (i) summarize the existing evidence indicating the subcellular distribution and characterization of various histidine kinases in the islet beta-cell, (ii) describe evidence for functional regulation of these kinases by agonists of insulin secretion, (iii) present a working model to implicate novel regulatory roles for histidine kinases in the receptor-independent activation, by glucose, of G-proteins endogenous to the beta-cell, (iv) summarize evidence supporting the localization of protein histidine phosphatases in the islet beta-cell and (v) highlight experimental evidence suggesting potential defects in the histidine kinase signalling cascade in islets derived from the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a model for type 2 diabetes.

Identification as ferritin L chain and determination of the RNA/protein binding characteristics. In cultured rat hepatocytes the degradation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA might be regulated by protein(s), which by binding to the mRNA alter its stability. The 3'-untranslated region of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA as a potential target was used to select RNA-binding protein(s) from rat liver by the use of gel retardation assays. A cytosolic protein was isolated, which bound to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA 3'-untranslated region and other in vitro synthesized RNAs. The protein was purified to homogeneity; it had an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa and consisted of identical subunits with an apparent size of 24.5 kDa. Sequence analysis of a tryptic peptide from the 24.5-kDa protein revealed its identity with rat ferritin light chain. Binding of ferritin to RNA was abolished after phosphorylation with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and was augmented after dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Weak binding was observed in extracts from okadaic acid-treated cultured hepatocytes compared with untreated cells. Preincubation of ferritin with an anti-phosphoserine or an anti-phosphothreonine antibody attenuated binding to RNA, while an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody generated a supershift indicating that phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine residues were in close proximity to the RNA-binding region. Ferritin is the iron storage protein in the liver. Binding of ferritin to RNA was diminished in the presence of increasing iron concentrations, whereas the iron chelator desferal was without effect.

The assay involves precolumn derivatization of an amino acid mixture with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) at room temperature, followed by separation of phosphoamino acids from other amino acids by HPLC. The liquid chromatography was carried out on a C18 reverse-phase column at pH 7.4 and 30 degrees C using gradient elution with eluent A as 157 mM sodium acetate containing 2% acetonitrile and eluent B as 60% acetonitrile in water. A uv absorption at 254 nm is employed for detection of the PITC-derivatized amino acids eluting from the column.

That the enzyme is a glycoprotein is surmised from its chromatographic property on Concanavalin A-Sepharose column. An examination of the substrate specificity indicates that the enzyme exhibits a preference for phosphotyrosine over a number of phosphocompounds, including p-nitrophenylphosphate and several glycolytic intermediates. Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The phosphatase activity is not affected by high concentrations of chelating agents and does not require metal ions. Molybdate, orthovanadate, Zn2+, and Hg2+ are all potent inhibitors of the phosphatase activity. The ability of the phosphatase to dephosphorylate protein phosphotyrosine has been investigated. [32P-Tyr]poly(Glu,Tyr)n, [32P-Tyr]alkylated bovine serum albumin, [32P-Tyr]angiotensin-I, and [32P-Tyr]band 3 (from human erythrocyte) are all substrates of the phosphatase.

Our result further indicates that the neutral phosphatase is distinct from the wheat germ acid phosphatase. The latter enzyme is found to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl as well as phosphoseryl and phosphothreonyl groups in proteins.

For antibody production, the O-phosphorylated derivative of tyrosine, threonine, or serine was covalently linked to succinylated bovine albumin via the carbodiimide reaction. Each conjugate was then complexed with methylated bovine albumin for immunization of rabbits. To determine binding, the corresponding O-phosphorylated [3H]amino acids were chemically synthesized. In addition, these 3H-phosphorylated derivatives were acylated (with succinic or acetic anhydride) to obtain ligands whose structures resemble those present in the immunogen. The acylated ligands bound to their respective antibodies more effectively: in some cases binding was about three orders of magnitude greater than their non-acylated counterparts. Radioimmunoassays were therefore developed using the N-succinyl-[3H]phosphoamino acids.

{"text": "Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the BRI1 Receptor Kinase Occurs via a Post-Translational Modification and is Activated by the Juxtamembrane Domain. In metazoans, receptor kinases control many essential processes related to growth and development and response to the environment. The receptor kinases in plants and animals are structurally similar but evolutionarily distinct and thus while most animal receptor kinases are tyrosine kinases the plant receptor kinases are classified as serine/threonine kinases. One of the best studied plant receptor kinases is Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 (BRI1), which functions in brassinosteroid signaling. Consistent with its classification, BRI1 was shown in early studies to autophosphorylate in vitro exclusively on serine and threonine residues and subsequently numerous specific phosphoserine and phosphothreonine sites were identified. However, several sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation have recently been identified establishing that BRI1 is a dual-specificity kinase. This raises the paradox that BRI1 contains phosphotyrosine but was only observed to autophosphorylate on serine and threonine sites. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine (and presumably serine) residues is a post-translational modification, ruling out a co-translational mechanism that could explain the paradox. Moreover, we show that in general, autophosphorylation of the recombinant protein appears to be hierarchical and proceeds in the order: phosphoserine\u2009>\u2009phosphothreonine\u2009>\u2009phosphotyrosine. This may explain why tyrosine autophosphorylation was not observed in some studies. Finally, we also show that the juxtamembrane domain of BRI1 is an activator of the kinase domain, and that kinase specificity (serine/threonine versus tyrosine) can be affected by residues outside of the kinase domain. This may have implications for identification of signature motifs that distinguish serine/threonine kinases from dual-specificity kinases.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 142}, "docId": "22891071", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 142, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 273, "charStart": 144}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 505, "charStart": 275}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 639, "charStart": 507}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 875, "charStart": 641}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1013, "charStart": 877}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1146, "charStart": 1015}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1377, "charStart": 1148}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1565, "charStart": 1379}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1649, "charStart": 1567}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1868, "charStart": 1651}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2007, "charStart": 1870}]}

We demonstrate that in human choriocarcinoma BeWo cells, the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate and PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide reciprocally down- and up-regulate, respectively, TEF-mediated GGAATG core enhancer activity. In vitro TEF-1 phosphorylation with several PKC isozymes and phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that TEF-1 is a potential PKC substrate. TEF-1.DNA complexes formed by BeWo nuclear extracts are supershifted by phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine- but not phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies, indicating that TEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo at serine and threonine residues. The TEF-1 phosphorylation domain was localized to the third alpha-helix of the DNA binding domain and adjacent hinge region by phosphopeptide analysis. TEF-1 phosphorylation significantly reduced its DNA binding activity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a possible mechanism for the inhibitory action of PKC. Finally, BeWo cells contained abundant levels of gamma and delta PKC isoforms, and their overexpression resulted in even greater inhibition of GGAATG core enhancer activity after 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate treatment.

{"text": "Mechanism of PhosphoThreonine/Serine Recognition and Specificity for Modular Domains from All-atom Molecular Dynamics. BACKGROUND: Phosphopeptide-binding domains mediate many vital cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein recognition. We studied three well-known domains important for signal transduction: BRCT repeats, WW domain and forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. The first two recognize both phosphothreonine (pThr) and phosphoserine (pSer) residues, but FHA has high specificity for pThr residues. Here we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal how FHA exclusively chooses pThr and how BRCT and WW recognize both pThr/pSer. The work also investigated the energies and thermodynamic information of intermolecular interactions. RESULTS: Simulations carried out included wide-type and mutated systems. Through analysis of MD simulations, we found that the conserved His residue defines dual loops feature of the FHA domain, which creates a small cavity reserved for only the methyl group of pThr. These well-organized loop interactions directly response to the pThr binding selectivity, while single loop (the 2nd phosphobinding site of FHA) or in combination with \u03b1-helix (BRCT repeats) or \u03b2-sheet (WW domain) fail to differentiate pThr/pSer. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the domain pre-organizations constructed by conserved residues and the driving force of domain-phosphopeptide recognition provides structural insight into pThr specific binding, which also helps in engineering proteins and designing peptide inhibitors.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 117}, "docId": "21612598", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 117, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 251, "charStart": 119}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 384, "charStart": 253}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 520, "charStart": 386}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 658, "charStart": 522}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 760, "charStart": 660}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 833, "charStart": 762}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1028, "charStart": 835}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1275, "charStart": 1030}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1555, "charStart": 1277}]}

The Grb2 SH2 domain binds to Tyr1068 of EGFR and Tyr317 of Shc while its SH3 domains bind to mSos1. Therefore, EGF treatment potentially results in the formation of several multimeric signaling complexes, including EGFR-Grb2-mSos1, EGFR-Shc-Grb2-mSos1, and Shc-Grb2-mSos1, linking the receptor to activation of the Ras GTPase. We have purified Grb2, mSos1, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex to high homogeneity, and used these isolated proteins to obtain binding affinities of mSos1 for Grb2 and of either Grb2 or Grb2-mSos1 for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. mSos1 bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.4 microM; the stoichiometry of the Grb2-mSos1 complex was 1:1. An EGFR-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.7 microM, whereas the Shc-derived phosphopeptide bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.2 microM. Since Grb2 exists in a stable complex with mSos1, and both proteins can exist in a constitutive complex in unstimulated cells, we performed phosphopeptide binding studies on the Grb2-mSos1 complex to gain a better understanding of binding events in the intact cell. Grb2-mSos1 bound to both EGFR- and Shc-derived phosphopeptides with higher affinities (KD of 0.3 microM and 31 nM, respectively) than Grb2 alone. These findings suggest that the proximity of mSos1 to Grb2 in the complex can influence the interactions of the Grb2 SH2 domain with phosphopeptides and raise the possibility that in the Grb2-mSos1 complex the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 are not independent of each other but may be indirectly linked by mSos1.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 75, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 230, "charStart": 77}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 330, "charStart": 232}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 557, "charStart": 332}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 789, "charStart": 559}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 884, "charStart": 791}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1026, "charStart": 886}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1292, "charStart": 1028}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1438, "charStart": 1294}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1749, "charStart": 1440}], "mesh": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "GRB2 Adaptor Protein", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Kinetics", "Macromolecular Substances", "Mice", "Molecular Weight", "Phosphopeptides", "Protein Binding", "Proteins", "Recombinant Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Spectrum Analysis", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

We aimed to scale down a pTyr-phosphopeptide enrichment protocol to biopsy-level protein input and assess reproducibility and applicability to tumor needle biopsies. To this end, phosphopeptide immunoprecipitation using anti-phosphotyrosine beads was performed using 10, 5 and 1mg protein input from lysates of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line HCT116. Multiple needle biopsies from 7 human CRC resection specimens were analyzed at the 1mg-level. The total number of phosphopeptides captured and detected by LC-MS/MS ranged from 681 at 10mg input to 471 at 1mg HCT116 protein. ID-reproducibility ranged from 60.5% at 10mg to 43.9% at 1mg.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of label-free pTyr-phosphoproteomics at the tumor biopsy level based on reproducible analyses using 1mg of protein input. The considerable number of identified phosphopeptides at this level is attributed to an effective down-scaled immuno-affinity protocol as well as to the application of ID propagation in the data processing and analysis steps.

Estrogen-induced autocrine and paracrine growth factors are thought to stimulate endometrial proliferation. However, the proliferation is arrested at an early secretory phase although the amount of growth factors and their receptors remains constant. These receptors are protein tyrosine kinases which cause activating receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of signalling substances. One inhibitory mechanism is the reverse dephosphorylation by phosphatases hydrolysing phosphotyrosines. Previously, an acid phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was found in endometrial secretory glands. The purpose of this study was to evaluate its characteristics. Catalytic and immunohistochemical techniques were applied on sections obtained from human endometrium and other tissues. Endometrial acid phosphatase hydrolysed phosphotyrosine, not only at acid, but also at neutral pH values. An alternative substrate was alpha-naphthyl phosphate or beta-glycerophosphate but not phosphoserine. Activities were inhibited by tartrate and fluoride but not by formaldehyde. These catalytic properties are identical only to those of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). A PAP-like nature was also proved by positive PAP immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, endometrial glands contain a phosphotyrosine phosphatase which is identical to PAP.

Human Pin1 is involved in cancer developments and has been a pharmaceutical target. Thus, finding a high-affinity inhibitor of Pin1 has become an attractive topic. The WW domain of human Pin1 can recognize the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-proline (pS/pT-P) motifs, while its PPIase domain catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl bonds to regulate the cell cycle. Here we incorporated a series of 4-substituted proline derivatives into the phosphopeptides and investigated their affinities for the WW domain of Pin1 to develop better inhibitors of Pin1. On the basis of the ligand Myt1-T412 [PPA(pT)PP], we synthesized several phosphopeptides in which the proline residue in the pT-P motif was replaced with various 4-substituted proline derivatives. Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence anisotropy analyses show that the replacement of proline with (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline increases the binding affinity of the peptide. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that a more PPII-like structure of phosphopeptides makes them bind to the WW domain more tightly. Chemical shift perturbation experiments also indicate that (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline interacts with Trp34 of the WW domain in the binding site. Results of molecular modeling further suggested that a strong C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction induced by (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline is important in enhancing the affinity of the peptide for the WW domain.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Protein kinase C (PKC) is well-recognized to modify ligand-gated ion channels such as nicotinic ACh (nACh) receptors by phosphorylating the receptors. The aim of the present study was to obtain direct evidence for PKC activation through nACh receptors. METHODS: Two-electrode voltage-clamp was made to Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant Torpedo nACh receptors. Western blotting using antibodies against phospho-serine and phospho-threonine was carried out in oocytes expressing Torpedo nACh receptors. In situ PKC activation was monitored in cultured rat skeletal muscle cells expressing nACh receptors. RESULTS: In the Xenopus oocyte expression systems, ACh-evoked whole-cell membrane currents through wild-type Torpedo nACh receptors were depressed by GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, while currents through mutant receptors lacking PKC phosphorylation sites was not affected. In the Western blot analysis, ACh produced immunoreactive bands against an anti-phospho-serine or an anti-phospho-threonine antibody in oocytes expressing wild-type Torpedo nACh receptors, and those signals were attenuated by alpha-bungarotoxin, an inhibitor of nACh receptors, or GF109203X. In the in situ PKC assay using cultured rat muscle cells that expressed all the mRNAs for muscle nACh receptor subunits such as the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and e subunit, ACh activated PKC in the presence of atropine, an inhibitor of muscarinic ACh receptors, and the activation was abolished by alpha-bungarotoxin or GF109203X. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that ACh activates PKC through nACh receptors and that in turn, activated PKC constantly enhances ACh receptor responses by phosphorylating the receptors.

Calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein from brain, has been shown to possess a metal ion-dependent and calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase activity towards phosphorylase kinase and inhibitor-1 (Stewart, A. A., Ingebritsen, T. S., Manalan, A., Klee, C. B., and Cohen, P. (1982) FEBS Lett. 137, 80-84). In this report, we show that calcineurin can also dephosphorylate p-nitrophenyl phosphate and free phosphotyrosine. However, calcineurin does not show significant activity towards phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, or several other low molecular weight phosphocompounds tested. As we have found with phosphorylase kinase and phosphocasein, the dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and free phosphotyrosine is stimulated by calmodulin and is metal ion-dependent with the order of efficiency being Mn2+ much greater than Co2+ greater than Ca2+. The dephosphorylation of these substrates appears to be an intrinsic property of calcineurin and is not due to contamination by alkaline phosphatases since the pH optimum for calcineurin activity occurs at a neutral rather than an alkaline pH. The dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate provides an easy, rapid, and accurate method for the quantification of calcineurin activity as well as permitting insight into reaction kinetics. The dephosphorylation of free phosphotyrosine by calcineurin suggests that this compound may be a physiological substrate of calcineurin.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 106, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 395, "charStart": 108}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 408, "charStart": 397}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 524, "charStart": 410}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 684, "charStart": 526}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 957, "charStart": 686}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1396, "charStart": 959}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1534, "charStart": 1398}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Brain", "Calcium", "Calcium-Binding Proteins", "Calmodulin", "Calmodulin-Binding Proteins", "Cations, Divalent", "Cattle", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Kinetics", "Magnesium", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nitrophenols", "Organophosphorus Compounds", "Phosphotyrosine", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

We have examined the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of talin, a component of the cytoskeleton localized in the focal adhesions and, therefore, a potential substrate of p60v-src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus. p60v-src is a tyrosine kinase that induces high levels of phosphotyrosine and the disorganization of the cytoskeleton in transformed cells.

USA 82, 6576-6580] for the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we have detected phosphotyrosine residues in talin molecules immunoprecipitated from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed, but not normal, chicken embryo fibroblasts. Phospho amino acid analysis of talin from the infected cells confirmed the presence of phosphotyrosine, in addition to phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The extent of tyrosine modification in talin was compared to that in vinculin, the other focal adhesion component previously found to contain enhanced levels of phosphotyrosine in various retrovirus-transformed cells. A considerably (3 times) larger fraction of the talin than of the vinculin molecules was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. The phosphorylation of talin on tyrosine may be crucial for the expression of the abnormal morphology characteristic of cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 99, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 329, "charStart": 101}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 469, "charStart": 331}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 601, "charStart": 471}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 613, "charStart": 603}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 618, "charStart": 615}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 853, "charStart": 620}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1008, "charStart": 855}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1226, "charStart": 1010}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1355, "charStart": 1228}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1516, "charStart": 1357}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Avian Sarcoma Viruses", "Cell Transformation, Viral", "Cells, Cultured", "Chick Embryo", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Immunologic Techniques", "Muscle Proteins", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Talin", "Tyrosine", "Vinculin"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase can apparently directly phosphorylate and activate one or more serine kinases. The identities of such serine kinases and their modes of activation are still unclear. We have described a serine kinase (here designated insulin receptor serine (IRS) kinase) from rat liver membranes that co-purifies with IR on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The kinase was activated after phosphorylation of the membrane glycoproteins by casein kinase-1, casein kinase-2, or casein kinase-3 (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 171: 75-83,1990). In this study, IRS kinase was further characterized. The presence of vanadate or phosphotyrosine in reaction mixtures was required for activation to be observed. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are only about 25% as effective as phosphotyrosine, whereas sodium fluoride and molybdate were ineffective in supporting activation. Vanadate and phosphotyrosine support IRS kinase activation by apparently inhibiting phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases present among the membrane glycoproteins. IR beta-subunit, myelin basic protein, and microtubule-associated protein-2 are good substrates for IRS kinase. The kinase prefers Mn2+ (Ka = 1.3 mM) as a metal cofactor. Mg2+ (Ka = 3.3 mM) is only 30% as effective as Mn2+. The kinase activity is stimulated by basic polypeptides, with greater than 30-fold activation achieved with polylysine and protamine. Our results suggest that both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation are required for activation of IRS kinase. Serine phosphorylation is catalyzed by one of the casein kinases, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation is catalyzed by a membrane tyrosine kinase, possibly IR tyrosine kinase.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 91, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 212, "charStart": 93}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 299, "charStart": 214}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 472, "charStart": 301}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 651, "charStart": 474}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 704, "charStart": 653}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 813, "charStart": 706}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 981, "charStart": 815}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1144, "charStart": 983}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1256, "charStart": 1146}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1315, "charStart": 1258}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1368, "charStart": 1317}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1502, "charStart": 1370}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1621, "charStart": 1504}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 1793, "charStart": 1623}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Casein Kinases", "Catalysis", "Enzyme Activation", "Membranes", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Myelin Basic Protein", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Rats", "Receptor, Insulin", "Substrate Specificity"], "type": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a member of the STAT family of proteins, implicated in cell growth and differentiation. STAT activation is regulated by phosphorylation of protein monomers at conserved tyrosine residues, followed by binding to phospho-peptide pockets and subsequent dimerization. STAT5 is implicated in the development of severe pathological conditions, including many cancer forms. However, nowadays a few STAT5 inhibitors are known, and only one crystal structure of the inactive STAT5 dimer is publicly available. With a view to enabling structure-based drug design, we have: (1) analyzed phospho-peptide binding pockets on SH2 domains of STAT5, STAT1 and STAT3; (2) generated a model of STAT5 bound to phospho-peptides; (3) assessed our model by docking against a class of known STAT5 inhibitors (M\u00fcller et al. in ChemBioChem 9:723-727, 2008); (4) used molecular dynamics simulations to optimize the molecular determinants responsible for binding and (5) proposed unique \"Binding Signatures\" of STAT5.

Data dependent neutral loss triggered MS3 methodology (NLMS3) is often applied to acquire MS data for the analysis of phosphopeptides. Some phosphopeptides tend to seriously lose the phosphate and result in MS2 spectra with poor fragments and fragment-rich MS3 spectra, while some phosphopeptides do not lose phosphate and result in nice MS2 spectra. Since different phosphopeptides have fragment spectra with different characteristics, filtering all of the phosphopeptide identifications by setting a global filter criteria may be inappropriate and result in low sensitivity. In this study, we developed a classification filtering strategy to improve the phosphopeptide identification and phosphorylation site localization. Phosphopeptide identifications were classified into four classes according to their different characteristics, and then, the identifications from each class of mass spectra were processed and filtered separately using different filtering strategies. It was found that the overlap of phosphopeptide identifications from different classes was low and the classification strategy significantly improved the coverage of the phosphoproteome analysis.
