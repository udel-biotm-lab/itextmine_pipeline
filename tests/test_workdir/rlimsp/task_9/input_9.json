In this work, we first immobilized tin(IV) ion on polydopamine-coated magnetic graphene (magG@PDA) to synthesize Sn4+ -immobilized magG@PDA (magG@PDA-Sn4+ ) and successfully applied the material to highly selective enrichment of phosphopeptides. The material gathered the advantages of large surface area of graphene, superparamagnetism of Fe3 O4 , good hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of polydopamine, and strong interaction between Sn4+ and phosphopeptides. The enrichment performance of magG@PDA-Sn4+ toward phosphopeptides from digested \u03b2-casein at different concentrations, with and without added digested BSA was investigated and compared with magG@PDA-Ti4+ . The results showed high selectivity and sensitivity of the Sn4+ -IMAC material toward phosphopeptides, as good as the Ti4+ -IMAC material. Finally, magG@PDA-Sn4+ was applied to the analysis of endogenous phosphopeptides from a real sample, human saliva, with both MALDI-TOF MS and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. The results indicated that the as-synthesized Sn4+ -IMAC material not only has good enrichment performance, but also could serve as a supplement to the Ti4+ -IMAC material and expand the phosphopeptide coverage enriched by the single Ti4+ -IMAC material, demonstrating the broad application prospects of magG@PDA-Sn4+ in phosphoproteome research.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 115, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 361, "charStart": 117}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 579, "charStart": 363}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 785, "charStart": 581}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 924, "charStart": 787}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1432, "charStart": 926}], "mesh": ["Caseins", "Chromatography, Affinity", "Graphite", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Indoles", "Magnetics", "Phosphopeptides", "Polymers", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Tin", "Titanium"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

RATIONALE: A liquid matrix, 3-aminoquinoline (3-AQ)/\u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), introduced by Kolli et al. in 1996 for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), has been reported for peptides and proteins, oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides, and glycopeptides. However, it has not been validated for phosphopeptides. METHODS: We optimized sample preparation using 3-AQ/CHCA for phosphopeptides. The sensitivity of six phosphopeptide species as isolated or in digests was systematically evaluated by using MALDI-quadropole ion trap (QIT)-time of flight (TOF) MS in positive and negative ion modes, and compared with the conventional methods using a solid matrix, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHB). RESULTS: The sensitivity of mono- and tetraphosphopeptides was improved 10- to 10 000-fold with the optimized preparation method using 3-AQ/CHCA compared with the conventional methods using 2,5-DHB. Improvement by 3-AQ/CHCA itself was 10-fold. Adding ammonium dihydrogen phosphate or an analyte solvent composition was also effectively improved the sensitivity. Phosphopeptides in isolated form or in digests were detected at femto- or subfemtomole levels. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of phosphopeptides was improved by the optimized sample preparation method using 3-AQ/CHCA compared with the conventional method using 2,5-DHB.

A novel protein phosphatase cDNA of the PPP superfamily was identified from the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), and tentatively named PfPPJ. The predicted primary structure of the phosphatase contained all the known conserved motifs of the PPP superfamily essential for catalytic activity. The enzyme was specific for dephosphorylation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues with very little activity against phosphotyrosine residues. However, the sequence at its C-terminal end was unique, and was consistent with its resistance to the classical PP2A-specific inhibitors such as okadaic acid and microcystin-LR, and the PP1-specific inhibitor, mammalian heat-stable inhibitor-2 (I-2). Even the catalytic core of PfPPJ had a sequence substantially different from the other PPPs such that PfPPJ could be placed in an apparently separate phylogenetic branch.

A procedure for measuring the activity of tyrosine-specific protein kinases was developed. The method is based on the fact that the phosphoryl groups of phosphotyrosine residues of phosphorylated protein substrates are not hydrolyzed in alkaline solutions, whereas the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues lose their phosphoryl groups upon heating in 2 N KOH. It was demonstrated that rat sarcoma XC cells in culture and in solid tumours contain tyrosine-specific protein kinase (TPK). The TPK is localized in the membrane fraction of the cells and is solubilized by 1% Triton X-100. Mn2+-ATP is a nucleotide substrate for TPK. Among other protein substrates, TPK strongly phosphorylates histones H5 and H2a, weakly phosphorylates histones H2b, H4 and H1 but does not phosphorylate protamine, casein, vinculin or angiotensin II. The optimal concentration of Mn2+ for the reaction is 2 mM; the Km values for ATP and histone H5 are 2-3 microM and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively. Tyrosine-specific protein kinases phosphorylating histone H5 were detected in the membrane fraction isolated from different mammalian tissues, e. g., spleen, heart, liver, brain and lungs, as well as from human intestinal mucosa and mucosal adenocarcinoma.

Moreover, pp59 did not comigrate with any of the autophosphorylated subunits of the Ca(2+)/calmodulindependent protein kinase in rat cerebellar membranes. Extraction of pp59 from these membranes could be accomplished with 6 M urea, but not with 0.4 M NaCl or 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100.

The binding of a growth factor to its specific receptor catalyzes a complex cascade of intracellular signaling events, characterized by changes in the phosphorylation state of many key proteins. Among these phosphorylation events, tyrosine phosphorylation plays a prominent role in the transmission of postreceptor signals. The state of tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by the actions of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs). Dysregulation of either event can lead to abnormal cellular responses. PTPs generally act to regulate negatively-that is, to turn off-any signals generated by PTKs. However, this is not always the case, as seen by the phosphatase SHP-2, which can either be a positive or negative regulator of signal transduction depending on the particular cellular context. In addition, a novel family of dual specificity phosphatases has been recently discovered. These enzymes are capable of dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine/phosphoserine residues, and seem to play a significant role in attenuating the action of MAP kinases. Several themes appear throughout PTP regulation of growth factor signaling, including positive or negative regulation, importance of cell/ tissue type, identity of the receptor activated, and subcellular localization.

Possible role of mitogen-activated protein kinase on the okadaic acid-induced NF-kappaB activation. Most types of cells can produce interleukin (IL)-8 in response to various inflammatory stimuli. To study the role of protein phosphatases in the signal transduction leading to IL-8 production, a subline of HL-60 (C-15) was treated with okadaic acid (OA) and sodium orthovanadate (VA), inhibitors of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase, respectively. Both OA and VA dramatically increased IL-8 secretion up to 200-fold in the HL-60 cells. OA and VA stimulation was accompanied by a marked increase in IL-8 mRNA expression and also by activation of a transcription factor, NF-kappaB. In addition, an essential role of the NF-kappaB site in the IL-8 gene activation was confirmed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. IL-8 production by OA or VA was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, including staurosporine, H-7, K252a, herbimycin A, and genistein. Both OA and VA induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p44, which was presumed to be Erk1, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, with concomitant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. In parallel, rapid degradation of IkappaB-alpha, an inhibitory component of NF-kappaB, was observed. Since OA-activated Erk1 phosphorylated recombinant IkappaB-alpha in vitro, we assumed that Erk1 is involved in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IkappaB-alpha, thus leading to the activation of IL-8 gene transcription.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 120, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 220, "charStart": 122}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 316, "charStart": 222}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 609, "charStart": 318}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 697, "charStart": 611}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 841, "charStart": 699}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 984, "charStart": 843}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1122, "charStart": 986}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1356, "charStart": 1124}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1457, "charStart": 1358}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1692, "charStart": 1459}], "mesh": ["Base Sequence", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases", "DNA", "HL-60 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrolysis", "Interleukin-8", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Molecular Sequence Data", "NF-kappa B", "Okadaic Acid", "Phosphorylation", "RNA, Messenger", "Tyrosine", "Vanadates"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

We have developed a new method for the quantification of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine as dabsyl derivatives in acid-hydrolyzed extracts of 32P-labeled A431 cells. In the first step the phosphamino acids are concentrated using a disposable anion-exchange column. Subsequently, the phosphoamino acid fraction is treated with dabsyl reagent (28.8 mM) for 10 min at 70 degrees C. After cleanup with a second anion-exchange column followed by separation on a disposable C18 column, the covalently modified phosphoamino acids are separated on silica TLC sheets using a one-dimensional solvent system. The major advantages of this method are the complete separation of dabsylated P-Ser, P-Thr, and P-Tyr on silica aluminum sheets in a very reproducible way without the interference of 32P contaminants originating from hydrolyzed cell extracts. Very clean chromatograms are obtained, enabling the fast and unambiguous quantification of the phosphoamino acids by simply cutting out the relevant spots from the aluminum sheets. A high sensitivity is achieved by the removal of the amino acids before derivatization of the sample. This allows the use of relatively low amounts of [32P]orthophosphate to load up the cells. Most important, the method allows the simultaneous analysis of dozens of samples within 1 day, making it a very convenient technique for routine analysis of the phosphorylation state of cultured cells.

In vitro assays revealed that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 may be at least partially responsible for SSP-stimulated EDG1 phosphorylation observed in intact cells.

Removal of 12 residues from the carboxyl terminus of EDG1 completely inhibited SSP-mediated internalization, suggesting that this domain dictates susceptibility to receptor internalization while retaining sensitivity to SSP-stimulated phosphorylation.

The modification of intracellular proteins by monosaccharides of O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and dynamic PTM of metazoans. The addition and removal of O-GlcNAc is catalyzed by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase, respectively. One mechanism by which O-GlcNAc is thought to mediate proteins is by regulating phosphorylation. To provide insight into the pathways regulated by O-GlcNAc, we have utilized SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to carry out comparisons of site-specific phosphorylation in OGT wild-type and Null cells. Quantitation of the phosphoproteome demonstrated that of 5529 phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine sites, 232 phosphosites were upregulated and 133 downregulated in the absence of O-GlcNAc.

BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) promotes survival and migration of endothelial cells, in part through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways downstream of Tie-2 receptors. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues on target MAPKs. The mechanisms by which DUSPs modulate MAPK activation in Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor signaling are unknown in endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of various DUSPs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to Ang-1 was measured. The functional roles of DUSPs in Ang-1-induced regulation of MAPK activation, endothelial cell survival, migration, differentiation, and permeability were measured using selective siRNA oligos. Ang-1 differentially induces DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through activation of the PI-3 kinase, ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK pathways. Lack-of-function siRNA screening revealed that DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates p38 protein and is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration and differentiation. DUSP4 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK proteins and, under conditions of serum deprivation, is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration, several antiapoptotic effects, and differentiation. DUSP5 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2 proteins and is involved in cell survival and inhibition of permeability.

BACKGROUND: Molecular signaling events associated with the necroinflammatory changes in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not well understood. AIMS: To understand the molecular basis of NASH, we evaluated reversible phosphorylation events in hepatic tissue derived from Class III obese subjects by phosphoproteomic means with the aim of highlighting key regulatory pathways that distinguish NASH from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (also known as simple steatosis; SS). MATERIALS & METHODS: Class III obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery underwent liver biopsy (eight normal patients, eight with simple steatosis, and eight NASH patients). Our strategy was unbiased, comparing global differences in liver protein reversible phosphorylation events across the 24 subjects. RESULTS: Of the 3078 phosphorylation sites assigned (2465 phosphoserine, 445 phosphothreonine, 165 phosphotyrosine), 53 were altered by a factor of 2 among cohorts, and of those, 12 were significantly increased or decreased by ANOVA (P < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Statistical analyses of canonical signaling pathways identified carbohydrate metabolism and RNA post-transcriptional modification among the most over-represented networks.

Therefore, investigating the exact positions of phosphorylation sites in GPCRs sequence could provide useful clues for drug design and other biotechnology applications. Experimental identification of phosphorylation sites is expensive and laborious. Hence, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for reliable prediction of phosphorylation sites from amino acid sequences. In this article, we presented a simple and effective method to recognize phosphorylation sites of human GPCRs by combining amino acid hydrophobicity and support vector machine.

{"text": "Selective Sensing of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Peptides Using Terbium(III) Complexes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins, as well as their dephosphorylation, is closely related to various diseases. However, this phosphorylation is usually accompanied by more abundant phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the proteins and covers only 0.05% of the total phosphorylation. Accordingly, highly selective detection of phosphorylated tyrosine in proteins is an urgent subject. In this review, recent developments in this field are described. Monomeric and binuclear Tb(III) complexes, which emit notable luminescence only in the presence of phosphotyrosine (pTyr), have been developed. There, the benzene ring of pTyr functions as an antenna and transfers its photoexcitation energy to the Tb(III) ion as the emission center. Even in the coexistence of phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr), pTyr can be efficintly detected with high selectivity. Simply by adding these Tb(III) complexes to the solutions, phosphorylation of tyrosine in peptides by protein tyrosine kinases and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases can be successfully visualized in a real-time fashion.

The method makes use of the differential stabilities of phosphohistidine and the common phosphohydroxyamino acids to alkali and acid treatments to measure phosphohistidine incorporation. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine are depleted by alkali treatment, while phosphohistidine, which is alkali-stable, is removed by acid treatment. Phosphotyrosine is stable to both alkali and acid treatments.

These are suggested to reflect a single site of phosphorylation, with proteolysis by trypsin being incomplete, and where C2 is larger than C1, which is larger than C3. An identical pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was seen in hepatocytes treated with either vasopressin or PMA, although labelling of this group of peptides was increased by approximately 2-fold compared with the basal state. In contrast, treatment of hepatocytes with glucagon, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP or forskolin not only resulted in increased labelling of the 'basal' sites approximately 3-fold, but identified a novel positively charged tryptic phosphoserine-containing peptide (AN). All four tryptic peptides were susceptible to proteolysis by V8 protease. Treatment of labelled alpha-Gi-2 from basal and PMA-treated cells produced a pattern of peptides which was identical with those found when the tryptic phosphopeptide was treated with V8 protease.

Primate lentiviruses encode for an unique nef gene with an essential function in both viral replication and pathogenicity in the host. The molecular basis for this function remains however poorly defined. Several Nef-binding cellular proteins are thought to be instrumental in its function. Indeed, Nef contains a proline-rich motif implicated in the binding to the Src-like tyrosine kinase Hck and also to a Ser/Thr kinase of molecular weight 62 kDa. The disruption of this motif affects the binding to both these kinases as well as viral replication. Whereas Hck is expressed in the myeloid lineage and hence may account for the nef function in infected monocytes, we and others have reported previously that Nef also interacts with the T-lymphocyte Src-kinase Lck, leading to specific cell signaling impairment. This interaction occurs through the binding of Nef to both Lck SH2 and SH3 domains. Both the proline motif and phosphorylation of Nef on tyrosine residue were proposed to account for these interactions. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Lck SH2 binding by HIV-1 Nef. Using recombinant fusion proteins to precipitate lysates, we show that although SH2 binding is dependent on phosphorylation events, it occurs in a tyrosine independent manner because it requires neither tyrosine residues in Nef nor the phosphotyrosine binding pocket from the Lck SH2 domain, hence suggesting a role for a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine residue. Further, we show that Hck SH2 does not interact with Nef, indicating that Hck SH3 binding is sufficient for Nef binding, whereas Lck SH2 cooperate together with SH3 to allow Nef binding to a level similar to Hck SH3. Together, our results establish different mechanisms for Hck and Lck binding by HIV-1 Nef protein, and identify a novel mechanism for Src-like tyrosine kinase targeting by a viral protein.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 158, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 293, "charStart": 160}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 363, "charStart": 295}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 449, "charStart": 365}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 610, "charStart": 451}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 711, "charStart": 612}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 973, "charStart": 713}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1057, "charStart": 975}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1176, "charStart": 1059}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1244, "charStart": 1178}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1611, "charStart": 1246}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1828, "charStart": 1613}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2017, "charStart": 1830}], "mesh": ["Gene Products, nef", "Genes, src", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Jurkat Cells", "Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein Conformation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck", "Virus Replication", "nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Treatment of murine macrophage monolayers with genistein, herbimycin A, tyrphostin 25 or staurosporine prior to infection decreased parasite invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Contrary, addition of sodium orthovanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phosphotyrosine and p-nitrophenyl phosphate to the interaction medium, significantly increased parasite binding and internalization, whereas phosphoserine and phosphothreonine had no effect. The phosphatase activity of intact promastigotes was greater than that of macrophages. Western blot analysis revealed tyrosine-phosphorylated bands from 198 to 28 kDa following macrophage challenge with promastigotes. Uninfected macrophages displayed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, possibly indicating an inducible process, while in parasites it was constitutive, as seen by the presence of 42, 40 and 35 kDa phosphoproteins on the Leishmania lysates. Immunofluorescence and immunogold detection of phosphotyrosine residues in some promastigote-macrophage attachment areas, but not in the vicinity of ingested parasites, suggest that Leishmania-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is an early, local and short-lived event. Genistein treatment of Leishmania-infected cells significantly enhanced the parasite burden.

E-cadherin is a transmembrane calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that is complexed with cytoplasmic proteins including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), and actin. We have identified two heterodimeric complexes which demonstrate that alpha-catenin interacts directly with beta-catenin, or with plakoglobin, in the absence of E-cadherin. beta-Catenin has previously been shown to bind directly to E-cadherin. We propose that E-cadherin associates with alpha-catenin, and thereby the actin cytoskeleton, via either beta-catenin or plakoglobin. We have further identified three new but related protein components of the E-cadherin complex, which are each cross-reactive by Western blot analysis to antibodies directed against p120, a phosphotyrosine substrate of src, and a phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine substrate of growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways.

The antagonist Arg0, Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7-BK completely inhibited the response indicating that BK was acting via a B2 kinin receptor.

We report that the corresponding amino-terminal phosphoserines of avian IkappaB-alpha are phosphorylation targets leading to inactivation of IkappaB-alpha upon stimulation. In addition, we show differential roles for these two serines. Mutation of serine 40 to alanine blocks all stimuli tested (TNF-alpha, phorbol ester, and anti-CD3 and anti-CD28), leading to NF-kappaB activation, while mutation of serine 36 to alanine attenuates only certain transduced signals (PMA, TNF-alpha). These novel findings support the hypothesis that the amino-terminal phosphoserine residues of avian IkappaB-alpha differentially mediate NF-kappaB signal transduction pathways and activation by distinct signals, thereby resulting in the activation NF-kappaB.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 72, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 235, "charStart": 74}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 334, "charStart": 237}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 492, "charStart": 336}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 665, "charStart": 494}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 728, "charStart": 667}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 976, "charStart": 730}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1235, "charStart": 978}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Antigens, CD", "Apoptosis", "Birds", "Cell Line", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Genes, Reporter", "Humans", "I-kappa B Proteins", "Jurkat Cells", "NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha", "NF-kappa B", "Phosphorylation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Serine", "Signal Transduction", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate", "Transfection", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The activation and recruitment of CD4(+) T cells are critical for the development of efficient antitumor immunity and may allow for the optimization of current cancer immunotherapy strategies. Searching for more optimal and selective targets for CD4(+) T cells, we have investigated phosphopeptides, a new category of tumor-derived epitopes linked to proteins with vital cellular functions. Although MHC I-restricted phosphopeptides have been identified, it was previously unknown whether human MHC II molecules present phosphopeptides for specific CD4(+) T cell recognition. We first demonstrated the fine specificity of human CD4(+) T cells to discriminate a phosphoresidue by using cells raised against the candidate melanoma antigen mutant B-Raf or its phosphorylated counterpart. Then, we assessed the presence and complexity of human MHC II-associated phosphopeptides by analyzing 2 autologous pairs of melanoma and EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid lines. By using sequential affinity isolation, biochemical enrichment, mass spectrometric sequencing, and comparative analysis, a total of 175 HLA-DR-associated phosphopeptides were characterized. Many were derived from source proteins that may have roles in cancer development, growth, and metastasis. Most were expressed exclusively by either melanomas or transformed B cells, suggesting the potential to define cell type-specific phosphatome \"fingerprints.\" We then generated HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted CD4(+) T cells specific for a phospho-MART-1 peptide identified in both melanoma cell lines. These T cells showed specificity for phosphopeptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells as well as for intact melanoma cells. This previously undescribed demonstration of MHC II-restricted phosphopeptides recognizable by human CD4(+) T cells provides potential new targets for cancer immunotherapy.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 104, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 297, "charStart": 106}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 495, "charStart": 299}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 680, "charStart": 497}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 889, "charStart": 682}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1066, "charStart": 891}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1256, "charStart": 1068}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1362, "charStart": 1258}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1520, "charStart": 1364}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1659, "charStart": 1522}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1781, "charStart": 1661}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1954, "charStart": 1783}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "HLA-DR Antigens", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class II", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "MART-1 Antigen", "Melanoma", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Phosphopeptides", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

RATIONALE: Despite advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification, effective phosphopeptide enrichment is a prerequisite towards comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis. Based on the different binding affinities and coordination geometries of the Ti(4+) and Fe(3+) ions with the phosphate group, we report a complementary metal-directed immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) method to increase the identification coverage of a phosphoproteome. METHODS: Phosphopeptides from standard phosphoproteins and Raji B cells were enriched from Ti(4+)-IMAC and Fe(3+)-IMAC methods, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS and Orbitrap MS analysis. Optimal enrichment specificity was achieved by selection of acid structure/concentration and organic solvent to compete with non-phosphopeptides. The effect of the metal ion and the chelating compound was evaluated by the comparison of the characteristics of enriched phosphopeptides between Ti(4+)-IMAC, Fe(3+)-IMAC and TiO(2) methods. RESULTS: To address the low enrichment specificity of the Ti(4+)-IMAC method, a simple one-step acid/solvent controlled IMAC method was developed with significantly improved specificity (88%) and recovery (93%). The most striking discovery is that the optimal Ti(4+)-IMAC and Fe(3+)-IMAC methods have low overlapping percentage (10%) among the 2905 enriched phosphopeptides from Raji cells, comprised of the distinct characteristics including hydrophobicity, amino acid compositions, and frequency of multiple phosphorylation of the phosphopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: The reported Fe(3+)-IMAC and Ti(4+)-IMAC methods can complementarily enrich acidic and basic phosphopeptides to effectively increase the identification coverage of an heterogeneous phosphoproteome (twice than the single approach). Given the reproducibility and low sample loss, the combination of our enrichment strategy with a quantitative technique could be feasible for quantitative phosphoproteomics.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 131, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 310, "charStart": 133}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 599, "charStart": 312}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 820, "charStart": 601}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 966, "charStart": 822}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1157, "charStart": 968}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1369, "charStart": 1159}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1707, "charStart": 1371}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1951, "charStart": 1709}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 2125, "charStart": 1953}], "mesh": ["Acetonitriles", "Cations", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Chromatography, Affinity", "Databases, Protein", "Ferric Compounds", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Phosphopeptides", "Proteomics", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Titanium", "Trifluoroacetic Acid"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3K) plays a central part in the mediation of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. No genetic studies of this enzyme in human syndromes of severe insulin resistance have been previously reported. METHODS: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 alpha regulatory subunit cDNA was examined in 20 subjects with syndromes of severe insulin resistance by single strand conformational polymorphism and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity and recruitment into phosphotyrosine complexes of variants of p85 alpha were studied in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Phosphopeptide binding characteristics of wild-type and mutant p85 alpha-GST fusion proteins were examined by surface plasmon resonance. RESULTS: The common p85 alpha variant, Met326I1e, was identified in 9 of the 20 subjects. Functional studies of the Met326Ile variant showed it to have equivalent insulin-stimulated lipid kinase activity and phosphotyrosine recruitment as wild-type p85 alpha. A novel heterozygous mutation, Arg409Gln, was detected in one subject. Within the proband's family, carriers of the mutation had a higher median fasting plasma insulin (218 pmol/l) compared with wild-type relatives (72 mol/l) (n = 8 subjects, p = 0.06). The Arg409Gln p85 alpha subunit was associated with lower insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity compared with wild-type (mean reduction 15%, p < 0.05, n = 5). The recruitment of Arg409Gln p85 alpha into phosphotyrosine complexes was not significantly impaired. GST fusion proteins of wild-type and mutant p85 alpha showed identical binding to phosphopeptides in surface plasmon resonance studies. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in p85 alpha are uncommon in subjects with syndromes of severe insulin resistance. The Met326Ile p85 alpha variant appears to have no functional effect on the insulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. The impaired phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity of the Arg409Gln mutant suggests that it could contribute to the insulin resistance seen in this family.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 162, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 291, "charStart": 164}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 404, "charStart": 293}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 645, "charStart": 406}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 825, "charStart": 647}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 962, "charStart": 827}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1052, "charStart": 964}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1222, "charStart": 1054}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1293, "charStart": 1224}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1476, "charStart": 1295}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1651, "charStart": 1478}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1753, "charStart": 1653}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1889, "charStart": 1755}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2009, "charStart": 1891}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2140, "charStart": 2011}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2293, "charStart": 2142}], "mesh": ["Adult", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line", "Fasting", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Male", "Pedigree", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Phosphorylation", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "Signal Transduction", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

A new phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domain (also known as the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain) has been described in the amino terminus of Shc. The Shc PI domain binding specificity is dependent on residues lying amino-terminal to the phosphotyrosine rather than carboxyl-terminal as is seen with SH2 domains. We randomly mutagenized the Shc PTB/PI domain in an effort to identify residues in the domain crucial for interaction with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides.

The defining structural feature of all of the caseins is their common phosphorylation sequence. In milk, these phosphoserine residues combine with inorganic calcium and phosphate to form colloidal complexes. In addition, nutritional benefits have been ascribed to the phosphopeptides from casein. To obtain a molecular basis for the functional, chemical, and biochemical properties of these casein peptides, the secondary structure of the phosphopeptide of bovine beta-casein (1-25) was reexamined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Both methods predict secondary structures for the peptide which include polyproline II elements as well as beta-extended sheet and turn-like elements. These structural elements were highly stable from 5 degrees to 70 degrees C. Reexamination of previously published 1H NMR data using chemical shift indices suggests structures in accord with the CD and FTIR data. Dephosphorylation showed little or no secondary structural changes, as monitored by CD and FTIR, but the modified peptide demonstrated pronounced self-association. The polymers formed were not highly temperature sensitive, but were pressure sensitive as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation at selected rotor speeds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated relatively large volume changes for the dephosphorylated peptide, in accord with the pressure dependent aggregation observed in the analytical ultracentrifuge data. In contrast the native peptide in MD remained relatively rigid.

The local specificity determinants for a T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) have been inspected with the aid of a series of synthetic peptides, either enzymically or chemically phosphorylated, derived from the phosphoacceptor sites of phosphotyrosyl proteins. The truncated form of T-cell PTP, deprived of its C-terminal down-regulatory domain, readily dephosphorylates submicromolar concentrations of eptapeptides to eicosapeptides, reproducing the C-terminal down-regulatory site of pp60c-src (Tyr527), the phosphorylated loop IV of calmodulin and the main autophosphorylation site of two protein tyrosine kinases of the src family (Tyr416 of pp60c-src and Tyr412 of p51fgr). However, phosphopeptides of similar size, derived from phosphoacceptor tyrosyl sites of the abl and epidermal-growth-factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases, the phosphorylated loop III of calmodulin, and phosphoangiotensin II undergo either very slow or undetectable dephosphorylation, even if tested up to 1 microM concentration. The replacement of either Ser-P or O-methylated phosphotyrosine for phosphotyrosine within suitable peptide substrates gives rise to totally inert derivatives. Moreover, amino acid substitutions around phosphotyrosine in the peptides src(412-418), src(414-418) and abl-(390-397) deeply influence the dephosphorylation efficiency. From these data and from a comparative analysis of efficient versus poor phosphopeptide substrates, it can be concluded that acidic residues located on the N-terminal side of phosphotyrosine, with special reference to position -3, play a crucial role in substrate recognition, while basic residues in the same positions act as negative determinants.
