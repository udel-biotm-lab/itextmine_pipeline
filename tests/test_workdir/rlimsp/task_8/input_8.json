Biochemical and structural studies have revealed key aspects of these interactions that account for their ability to discriminate between different sequence motifs.

Characterization of synthetic peptide substrates for the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor serine kinase. The identity of the sites of insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation in the human insulin receptor was examined by synthesizing peptides that together encompassed all the serine residues of the cytosolic portion of the beta-subunit and testing them as substrates for phosphorylation by a preparation of human insulin receptor copurified with insulin-stimulated insulin receptor serine kinase activity. Of the 14 peptides studied, only 4 (1071--1080, 1290--1298, 1253--1271, and 1313--1329) were phosphorylated on serine, with the serine phosphorylation stimulated 2--4-fold by insulin. Peptides 1071--1080 and 1290--1298 were 3--7-fold better substrates for the serine phosphorylation than the other serine-phosphorylated peptides. Peptides 1071--1080 and 1313--1329 also exhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation on tyrosine. Two-dimensional thin-layer tryptic mapping of the phosphorylated insulin receptor/insulin-stimulated insulin receptor serine kinase preparation or of insulin receptor phosphorylated in human Hep G2 cells yielded two major peptides, called S1 and S2, that ran as a pair of closely migrating spots, and other lesser peptides that contained phosphoserine. S1 and S2 also contained some phosphotyrosine and gave phosposerine/phosphotyrosine ratios of approximately 6 and 0.96-1.50 for the in vivo and in vitro labeled receptor, respectively. S1 and S2 were not cleaved by V8. Of the serine-phosphorylated peptides, only 1290--1298 and 1071--1080 should be V8 resistant; 1290--1298 contains serine sites 1293/4 and migrated distinctly from S1 and S2 in tryptic maps. Peptide 1071--1080 mimicked the production of S1 and S2 in tryptic maps yielding a doublet of phosphopeptides, each containing phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine, which comigrated exactly with S1 and S2. Comigration was confirmed at a different pH and by mixing experiments. Radiosequenation showed that serine 1078 was phosphorylated. Tyrosine 1075 was also phosphorylated, but it was no more than a minor site in vivo. It is concluded that serine 1078 of the insulin receptor is a major site of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro.

In this study, potential cellular enzymes involved in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) L-directed Nup phosphorylation were screened with a panel of specific, cell-permeating kinase inhibitors. Extracellular signal-regulated receptor kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors (U0126 and SB203580) were sufficient to block Nup hyperphosphorylation in EMCV-infected or L-expressing cells. Recombinant L alone, in the absence of infection, triggered activation of ERK and p38, independent of their upstream signaling cascades. Conserved residues within the L zinc finger (Cys(19)) and acidic domain (Asp(48),(51),(52),(55)) were essential for this activation and for the phosphorylation of Nups, suggesting that the phenomena are linked.

Phosphoamino acid analysis of protein p55 from 32P-labeled S-phase and M-phase HeLa cell extracts after immunoprecipitation with anti-p55 antibodies revealed that threonine was extensively phosphorylated in p55 during G2-M but not in S phase, whereas serine was phosphorylated during both S and M phases.

HNF-4\u03b1 regulates a large number of liver-specific genes, many of which are modulated by injury. While HNF-4\u03b1 function is regulated by phosphorylation, only a limited number of phosphorylation sites in HNF-4\u03b1 have been identified, and the roles of HNF-4\u03b1 phosphorylation after injury are unexplored. To address these issues, we have carried out an extensive quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of HNF-4\u03b1 serine and threonine phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation. Studies were performed in HNF-4\u03b1-enriched HepG2 cells treated with cytokines for 3 h or left untreated, followed by chemical derivatization of the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues using stable isotopic variants of dithiothreitol (DTT) and MS analysis. This has allowed the identification and relative quantification of 12 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in HNF-4\u03b1.

The mixed-bed ion-exchange resin improved peptide recovery over SCX resins alone and showed better orthogonality to RP separations in two-dimensional separations.

An increase in orthogonality was achieved by a combination of increased retention for acidic peptides and moderately reduced retention of neutral to basic peptides by the added anion-exchange resin. The combination of these effects led to approximately 100% increase in the number of identified peptides from an analysis of a tryptic digest of a yeast whole cell lysate. The application of the method to phosphopeptide-enriched samples increased by 94% phosphopeptide identifications over SCX alone. The lower pKa of phosphopeptides led to specific enrichment in a single salt step resolving acidic phosphopeptides from other phospho- and non-phosphopeptides. Unlike previous methods that use anion exchange to alter selectivity or enrich phosphopeptides, the proposed format is unique in that it works with typical acidic buffer systems used in electrospray ionization, making it feasible for online multidimensional LC/MS/MS applications.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 113, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 365, "charStart": 115}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 500, "charStart": 367}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 663, "charStart": 502}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 940, "charStart": 665}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1139, "charStart": 942}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1311, "charStart": 1141}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1440, "charStart": 1313}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1600, "charStart": 1442}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1881, "charStart": 1602}], "mesh": ["Chromatography, Liquid", "Ion Exchange Resins", "Peptides", "Phosphopeptides", "Proteomics", "Trypsin", "Yeasts"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Here, we implement weak anion exchange (WAX) chromatography as an additional, complementary dimension to strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase (RP).

Previous studies established both singly phosphorylated and doubly phosphorylated forms play a role in signaling. The structure of the doubly phosphorylated form identified a new recognition of phosphotyrosine whereby two phosphotyrosines bind simultaneously to the Vav SH2 domain, one in the canonical pTyr pocket and one in the specificity pocket on the opposite side of the central \u03b2-sheet. It is unknown if the specificity pocket can bind phosphotyrosine independent of phosphotyrosine binding the pTyr pocket. To address this gap in knowledge, we determined the structure of the complex between Vav1 SH2 and a peptide (SykLB-YpY) modeling the singly phosphorylated-Y346 form of Syk with unphosphorylated Y342. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data conclusively establish that recognition of phosphotyrosine is swapped between the two pockets; phosphorylated pY346 binds the specificity pocket of Vav1 SH2, and unphosphorylated Y342 occupies what is normally the pTyr binding pocket. Nearly identical changes in chemical shifts occurred upon binding all three forms of singly and doubly phosphorylated peptides; however, somewhat smaller shift perturbations for SykLB-YpY from residues in regions of high internal mobility suggest that internal motions are coupled to binding affinity.

By using the technique of isothermal titration calorimetry, we have studied the thermodynamics of binding of the Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXY-containing peptides derived from known receptor binding sites. The results showed that relative contributions of enthalpy and entropy to the free energy of binding are dependent on specific phosphopeptides.

The ionization of phosphorylated peptides in positive ion mode mass spectrometry is generally less efficient compared with the ionization of their non-phosphorylated counterparts. This can make phosphopeptides much more difficult to detect. One way to enhance the detection of phosphorylated proteins and peptides is by selectively isolating these species. Current approaches of phosphopeptide isolation are based on the favorable interactions of phosphate groups with immobilized metals. While these methods can be effective in the extraction, they can lead to incomplete sample recovery, particularly for the most strongly bound multiply phosphorylated components. A non-sorptive method of phosphopeptide isolation using capillary electrophoresis (CE) was recently reported [Zhang et al., Anal. Chem. 77 (2005) 6078]. The relatively low isoelectric points of phosphopeptides cause them to remain anionic at acidic sample pH. Hence, they can be selectively injected into the capillary by an applied field after the electroosmotic flow (EOF) is suppressed. The technique was previously coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). In this work, the exploitation of selective sampling in conjugation with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is presented. The transition was not immediately straightforward. A number of major alterations were necessary for ESI interfacing. These adaptations include the choice of a suitable capillary coating for EOF control and the incorporation of organic solvent for efficient ESI. As expected, selective injection of phosphopeptides greatly enhanced the sensitivity of their detection in ESI-MS, particularly for the multiply phosphorylated species that were traditionally most problematic. Furthermore, an electrophoretic separation subsequent to the selective injection of the phosphopeptides was performed prior to analysis by ESI-MS.

Metal and metal oxide chelating-based phosphopeptide enrichment technologies provide powerful tools for the in-depth profiling of phosphoproteomes. One weakness inherent to current enrichment strategies is poor binding of phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues. The problem is exacerbated when strong cation exchange (SCX) is used for pre-fractionation, as under low pH SCX conditions phosphorylated peptides with multiple basic residues elute with the bulk of the tryptic digest and therefore require more stringent enrichment. Here, we report a systematic evaluation of the characteristics of a novel phosphopeptide enrichment approach based on a combination of low pH SCX and Ti(4+)-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) comparing it one-to-one with the well established low pH SCX-TiO(2) enrichment method. We also examined the effect of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFP), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in the loading buffer, as it has been hypothesized that high levels of TFA and the perfluorinated solvent HFP improve the enrichment of phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues. We found that Ti(4+)-IMAC in combination with TFA in the loading buffer, outperformed all other methods tested, enabling the identification of around 5000 unique phosphopeptides containing multiple basic residues from 400 \u03bcg of a HeLa cell lysate digest. In comparison, \u223c 2000 unique phosphopeptides could be identified by Ti(4+)-IMAC with HFP and close to 3000 by TiO(2). We confirmed, by motif analysis, the basic phosphopeptides enrich the number of putative basophilic kinases substrates. In addition, we performed an experiment using the SCX/Ti(4+)-IMAC methodology alongside the use of collision-induced dissociation (CID), higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) and electron transfer dissociation with supplementary activation (ETD) on considerably more complex sample, consisting of a total of 400 \u03bcg of triple dimethyl labeled MCF-7 digest. This analysis led to the identification of over 9,000 unique phosphorylation sites. The use of three peptide activation methods confirmed that ETD is best capable of sequencing multiply charged peptides.

The process is typically time-consuming as, often, a combination of analytical approaches must be used. To facilitate throughput in the study of phosphoproteins, a microreactor that enables a novel strategy for performing fast proteolytic digestion and selective phosphopeptide enrichment was developed. The microreactor was fabricated using 100\u00a0\u03bcm i.d. fused-silica capillaries packed with 1-2\u00a0mm beds of C18 and/or TiO2 particles. Proteolytic digestion-only, phosphopeptide enrichment-only, and sequential proteolytic digestion/phosphopeptide enrichment microreactors were developed and tested with standard protein mixtures. The protein samples were adsorbed on the C18 particles, quickly digested with a proteolytic enzyme infused over the adsorbed proteins, and further eluted onto the TiO2 microreactor for enrichment in phosphopeptides. A number of parameters were optimized to speed up the digestion and enrichments processes, including microreactor dimensions, sample concentrations, digestion time, flow rates, buffer compositions, and pH. The effective time for the steps of proteolytic digestion and enrichment was less than 5\u00a0min. For simple samples, such as standard protein mixtures, this approach provided equivalent or better results than conventional bench-top methods, in terms of both enzymatic digestion and selectivity.

Because functionally significant substrates for the tyrosyl protein kinase activity of pp60v-src are likely to include membrane-associated proteins involved in normal growth control, we have tested the hypothesis that pp60v-src could phosphorylate and alter the signaling activity of transmembrane growth factor receptors. We have found that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor becomes constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells transformed by the src oncogene and in addition displays elevated levels of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. High-performance liquid chromatography phosphopeptide mapping revealed two predominant sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, both of which differed from the major sites of receptor autophosphorylation; thus, the src-induced phosphorylation is unlikely to occur via an autocrine mechanism. To determine whether pp60v-src altered the signaling activity of the EGF receptor, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma, since phosphorylation of this enzyme occurs in response to activation of the EGF receptor but not in response to pp60v-src alone. We found that in cells coexpressing pp60v-src and the EGF receptor, phospholipase C-gamma was constitutively phosphorylated, a result we interpret as indicating that the signaling activity of the EGF receptor was altered in the src-transformed cells. These findings suggest that pp60v-src-induced alterations in phosphorylation and function of growth regulatory receptors could play an important role in generating the phenotypic changes associated with malignant transformation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 108, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 431, "charStart": 110}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 664, "charStart": 433}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 950, "charStart": 666}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1230, "charStart": 952}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1481, "charStart": 1232}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1710, "charStart": 1483}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Line", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "ErbB Receptors", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)", "Peptide Mapping", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Rats", "Signal Transduction", "Transfection", "Type C Phospholipases", "Tyrosine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Thus, it has been suggested that PKC phosphorylates and desensitizes GC-A. Here, we have developed stable GC-A transfectants of NIH3T3 cells, which display marked reductions in hormone-dependent cGMP elevations and guanylyl cyclase activity after incubation with ANP or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). ANP binding and immunoblot analysis indicated that the decreases were not due to receptor internalization or degradation. GC-A isolated from 32PO4-labeled cells contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. ANP and/or PMA addition caused substantial decreases in the 32P content of the receptor that coincided with reductions in hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity. The specific PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X, completely blocked the PMA-dependent dephosphorylation and desensitization of GC-A but failed to inhibit either ANP-dependent process. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of GC-A isolated from ANP- or PMA-treated cells were unique, suggesting that the sites that dephosphorylated in response to each agent were different.

OBJECTIVE: Reversible serine/threonine protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases plays a crucial role in cellular growth and differentiation. We attempted to determine the subcellular location of serine/threonine phosphatase (protein phosphatase type 2A [PP2A]) in endometrial cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial cancers surgically removed were examined. PP2A activity was assessed by measuring the dephosphorylation of phosphopeptide highly selective for the PP2A in cytosol and membranes fractionated on a continuous sucrose density gradient. Its protein level was detected by immunoblotting with a specific antibody. RESULTS: There were three peaks of PP2A enzyme activity and immunoreactivity corresponding by marker enzyme analysis to the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum fractions. An enzyme kinetic analysis showed the different activity in cytosol and plasma membrane; K(m) values of 98+/-12 micromol/L for cytosol and 32+/-6.2 micromol/L for plasma membrane (P<.01), respectively. The membrane phosphatase was sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid and sodium fluoride, characteristics suggestive of PP2A activity. CONCLUSION: PP2A activity in the plasma membrane of endometrial cancers might be distinct from that present in the cytosol.

We have characterized the interaction of the APLF FHA domain with phosphorylated XRCC1 peptides using crystallographic, NMR, and fluorescence polarization studies. The FHA-FBM interactions exhibit significant pH dependence in the physiological range as a consequence of the atypically high pK values of the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues and the preference for a dianionic charge state of FHA-bound pThr. These high pK values are characteristic of the polyanionic peptides typically produced by CK2 phosphorylation. Binding affinity is greatly enhanced by residues flanking the crystallographically-defined recognition motif, apparently as a consequence of non-specific electrostatic interactions, supporting the role of XRCC1 in nuclear cotransport of APLF. The FHA domain-dependent interaction of XRCC1 with APLF joins repair scaffolds that support single-strand break repair and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

Most current technologies for the enrichment of phosphopeptides rely on a tandem combination of different chromatography modes. Here, a fully automatic two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was developed for global phosphopeptide identification. The peptide mixtures were loaded on a strong anion exchange (SAX) column under basic pH conditions and eluted with a continuous gradient to pH 2.0. This SAX system could be coupled online with reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS). For peptide digests from a standard protein mixture spiked with synthesized phosphopeptides, most of the nonphosphorylated peptides were eluted in more basic pH than phosphopeptides, and the phosphopeptides were focused to acidic pH ranges and gradually eluted according to the phosphorylated states of peptides. Compared with the pH step elution method, the continuous gradient method displayed better repeatability and less peptide cross-overlap between fractions. This system provided a robust and fully automatic approach to large-scale phosphoproteomic profiling.

The two major B cell substrates (61,000 and 55,000 daltons, p61 and p55) were gel purified after phosphorylation and exhaustively digested with trypsin. Separation by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated that these two substrates had two identical phosphotyrosine containing tryptic phosphopeptides. p61 had an additional phosphotyrosine site. Parallel analysis of the two T cell substrates (64,000 and 58,000 daltons, p64 and p58) showed that they also contained two phosphotyrosine sites that were identical. However, the tryptic phosphopeptides from the B and T cell substrate pairs were clearly distinct suggesting that they arise from different gene products. When B and T cell membrane fractions were preincubated with TLCK (21 degrees C, 30 min) a dose-dependent decrease in p64 and p58 phosphorylation resulted. p61 and p55 phosphorylation was not affected at concentrations up to 10 mM TLCK.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, mediates integrin-based cell signaling by transferring signals regulating cell migration, adhesion, and survival from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm. Following autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397, FAK binds the Src homology 2 domains of Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, among several other possible binding partners. To further investigate the role of phosphorylated FAK in cell migration in situ, peptides comprising residues 391-406 of human FAK with caged phosphotyrosine 397 were synthesized. Although the caged phosphopeptides were stable to phosphatase activity, the free phosphopeptides showed a half-life of approximately 10-15 min in cell lysates. Migrating NBT-II cells (a rat bladder tumor cell line) were microinjected with the caged FAK peptide and locally photoactivated using a focused laser beam. The photoactivation of caged FAK peptide in 8-microm diameter spots over the cell body led to the temporary arrest of the leading edge migration within approximately 1 min of irradiation. In contrast, cell body migration was not inhibited. Microinjection of a non-caged phosphorylated tyrosine 397 FAK peptide into migrating NBT-II cells also led to lamellar arrest; however, this approach lacks the temporal control afforded by the caged phosphopeptides. Photoactivation of related phosphotyrosine peptides with altered sequences did not result in transient lamellar arrest.

The Polo-Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) acts as a central regulator of mitosis and is over-expressed in a wide range of human tumours where high levels of expression correlate with a poor prognosis. PLK1 comprises two structural elements, a kinase domain and a polo-box domain (PBD). The PBD binds phosphorylated substrates to control substrate phosphorylation by the kinase domain. Although the PBD preferentially binds to phosphopeptides, it has a relatively broad sequence specificity in comparison with other phosphopeptide binding domains. We analysed the molecular determinants of recognition by performing molecular dynamics simulations of the PBD with one of its natural substrates, CDC25c. Predicted binding free energies were calculated using a molecular mechanics, Poisson-Boltzmann surface area approach. We calculated the per-residue contributions to the binding free energy change, showing that the phosphothreonine residue and the mainchain account for the vast majority of the interaction energy. This explains the very broad sequence specificity with respect to other sidechain residues. Finally, we considered the key role of bridging water molecules at the binding interface. We employed inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory to consider the free energy of water molecules on the protein surface with respect to bulk water molecules. Such an analysis highlights binding hotspots created by elimination of water molecules from hydrophobic surfaces. It also predicts that a number of water molecules are stabilized by the presence of the charged phosphate group, and that this will have a significant effect on the binding affinity.

The study of cellular dynamics by proteomics using mass spectrometry requires a quantitation strategy that is robust, sensitive, and of sufficient resolution to deal with subtle changes in protein expression or post-translational modification. The major quantitation strategies are stable isotopic labeling of proteins and peptides for in vitro cell culture systems (stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture, SILAC) or isobaric peptide labels such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tags (TMT) for both in vitro and in vivo systems. These quantitation strategies have also been successfully applied to phosphoproteomics studies for the investigation of signal transduction pathways. Here we describe major drawbacks associated with isobaric labeling for the identification and quantitation of phosphopeptides using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.

In order to immobilize Ti4+ ions on the surface of the magnetite nanoparticles, they were first covered by a silica shell and then modified to expose at the surface bromine containing groups. Glycidyl methacrylate was subsequently polymerized from these groups using the \"grafting from\" approach by the activator regenerated by electron transfer-atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET-ATRP) technique. Finally, the glycidyl groups were reacted with iminodiacetic acid to functionalize the material with moieties suitable for coordination. The prepared material was extensively characterized and subsequently tested for enrichment of a bovine serum albumin mixture with casein to ascertain its potential. With positive results, the new magnetic polymeric material was further employed to set up an enrichment method on yeast protein digest based on shotgun proteomics. The sample to phase ratio was optimized and the best condition compared to a commercial TiO2 spin column. At the end of the comparison, the new material proved better and could enrich a larger total number of phosphopeptides with increased selectivity.

Therefore, selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from highly complicated mixtures is vital for MS-based phosphoproteome analysis.

Enrichment of modified peptides from global peptides is inevitable in mass spectrometric analysis protein modifications because of their importance in the study of cellular functions and low abundance in the global proteomic analysis. Recent advances in enrichment methods for modified peptides such as phosphopeptides and intact glycopeptides (IGPs) show that the methods for proteomic analyses of both protein modifications are robust. We have recently observed and reported a large number of IGPs from phosphoproteomic analysis using IMAC-based phosphopeptides enrichment procedure. To determine whether phosphorylated peptides could be specifically isolated from coenriched IGPs in IMAC experiments with different pH, IMAC procedures were performed at different pH conditions, and we found that the enrichment of phosphopeptides at pH 2.0 was the optimal condition for having the highest number of phosphopeptide identifications; however, coenrichment of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides was inevitable in the entire pH range. The hydrophilic enrichments of IGPs performed before or after IMAC enrichment were evaluated subsequently to determine the optimal workflow for simultaneous analyses of phosphopeptides and glycopeptides, and IMAC enrichment followed by hydrophilic enrichment was chosen as the optimized workflow. Applying the workflow to the TMT-labeled peptides from luminal and basal-like type of breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models allowed quantitative analyses of phospho- and glycoproteomics with 17582 phosphopeptides and 3468 glycopeptides identified, and 1237 phosphopeptides and 236 glycopeptides showed significant expression differences between luminal and basal-like, respectively.

{"text": "Phosphotyrosine profiling of human cerebrospinal fluid. Background: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an important source of potential biomarkers that affect the brain. Biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders are needed to assist in diagnosis, monitoring disease progression and evaluating efficacy of therapies. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of tyrosine kinases in neuronal cell death. Thus, neurodegeneration in the brain is related to altered tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the brain and identification of abnormally phosphorylated tyrosine peptides in CSF has the potential to ascertain candidate biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: In this study, we used an antibody-based tyrosine phosphopeptide enrichment method coupled with high resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Lumos Fourier transform mass spectrometer to catalog tyrosine phosphorylated peptides from cerebrospinal fluid. The subset of identified tyrosine phosphorylated peptides was also validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted approach. Results: To date, there are no published studies on global profiling of phosphotyrosine modifications of CSF proteins. We carried out phosphotyrosine profiling of CSF using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-based enrichment and analysis using high resolution Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. We identified 111 phosphotyrosine peptides mapping to 66 proteins, which included 24 proteins which have not been identified in CSF previously. We then validated a set of 5 tyrosine phosphorylated peptides in an independent set of CSF samples from cognitively normal subjects, using a PRM-based targeted approach.

{"docId": "15647109", "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 148}, "text": "Fully automated synthesis of (phospho)peptide arrays in microtiter plate wells provides efficient access to protein tyrosine kinase characterization. BACKGROUND: Synthetic peptides have played a useful role in studies of protein kinase substrates and interaction domains. Synthetic peptide arrays and libraries, in particular, have accelerated the process. Several factors have hindered or limited the applicability of various techniques, such as the need for deconvolution of combinatorial libraries, the inability or impracticality of achieving full automation using two-dimensional or pin solid phases, the lack of convenient interfacing with standard analytical platforms, or the difficulty of compartmentalization of a planar surface when contact between assay components needs to be avoided. This paper describes a process for synthesis of peptides and phosphopeptides on microtiter plate wells that overcomes previous limitations and demonstrates utility in determination of the epitope of an autophosphorylation site phospho-motif antibody and utility in substrate utilization assays of the protein tyrosine kinase, p60c-src. RESULTS: The overall reproducibility of phospho-peptide synthesis and multiplexed EGF receptor (EGFR) autophosphorylation site (pY1173) antibody ELISA (9H2) was within 5.5 to 8.0%. Mass spectrometric analyses of the released (phospho)peptides showed homogeneous peaks of the expected molecular weights. An overlapping peptide array of the complete EGFR cytoplasmic sequence revealed a high redundancy of 9H2 reactive sites. The eight reactive phospopeptides were structurally related and interestingly, the most conserved antibody reactive peptide motif coincided with a subset of other known EGFR autophosphorylation and SH2 binding motifs and an EGFR optimal substrate motif. Finally, peptides based on known substrate specificities of c-src and related enzymes were synthesized in microtiter plate array format and were phosphorylated by c-Src with the predicted specificities. The level of phosphorylation was proportional to c-Src concentration with sensitivities below 0.1 Units of enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of this method to interface with various robotics and instrumentation is highly flexible since the microtiter plate is an industry standard. It is highly scalable by increasing the surface area within the well or the number of wells and does not require specialized robotics. The microtiter plate array system is well suited to the study of protein kinase substrates, antigens, binding molecules, and inhibitors since these all can be quantitatively studied at a single uniform, reproducible interface.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 148, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 270, "charStart": 150}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 355, "charStart": 272}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 796, "charStart": 357}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1132, "charStart": 798}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1313, "charStart": 1134}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1435, "charStart": 1315}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1556, "charStart": 1437}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1810, "charStart": 1558}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 2013, "charStart": 1812}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2128, "charStart": 2015}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2294, "charStart": 2130}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2429, "charStart": 2296}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2656, "charStart": 2431}], "mesh": ["Antigen-Antibody Reactions", "Automation", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "ErbB Receptors", "Mass Spectrometry", "Peptide Fragments", "Peptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphotyrosine", "Polylysine", "Protein Array Analysis", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Reproducibility of Results", "Robotics"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that governs biological processes. Despite the fact that a number of analytical strategies have been exploited for the characterization of protein phosphorylation, the identification of protein phosphorylation sites is still challenging. We proposed here an alternative approach to mine phosphopeptide signals generated from a mixture of proteins when liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis is involved. The approach combined dephosphorylation reaction, accurate mass measurements from a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and a computing algorithm to differentiate possible phosphopeptide signals obtained from the LC-MS analyses by taking advantage of the mass shift generated by alkaline phosphatase treatment. The retention times and m/z values of these selected LC-MS signals were used to facilitate subsequent LC-MS/MS experiments for phosphorylation site determination. Unlike commonly used neutral loss scan experiments for phosphopeptide detection, this strategy may not bias against tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. We have demonstrated the applicability of this strategy to sequence more, in comparison with conventional data-dependent LC-MS/MS experiments, phosphopeptides in a mixture of alpha- and beta-caseins.
