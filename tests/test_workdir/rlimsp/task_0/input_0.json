The activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) is restricted by their substrate specificities. The analysis of PTP specificity was greatly helped by the discovery that \"substrate-trapping\" PTP mutants, such as PTP-1B D181A, stably and specifically bind their substrates. We have set up a PTP substrate specificity assay based on the SPOT technique, which involves the microsynthesis of (phospho)peptides on membranes. To validate this approach, substrate trapping PTP-1B was tested on its cognate ligand, the autophosphorylated insulin receptor (IR). On SPOT membranes, IR peptides with phosphotyrosine 1163 were efficiently bound by PTP1B D181A, and dephosphorylated by PTP-1B. Phosphotyrosine 1163 was preferred over the neighboring 1158 and 1162 phosphotyrosines. PTP-1B also recognized IR-like motifs in Trk autophosphorylation domains, and STAT 5 phosphopeptides. Using a gridded 20-by-20 SPOT library, we show that peptides with the YZM motif (Z: phosphotyrosine) are the strongest ligands for PTP-1B D181A, but not the optimal substrates for dephosphorylation by wild-type PTP1B. In addition we show that PTP-1B and PTP-beta dephosphorylation efficiency is strongly modulated by the introduction of phospho-serine or phospho-threonine in their cognate phospho-tyrosine substrates.

Liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is key for the characterization of phosphorylation sites in a high-throughput manner, and its application has proven essential to elucidate the phosphoproteome of many biological systems. Following proteolytic digestion of proteins extracted from tissues or cells, phosphopeptides are typically enriched by affinity chromatography using TiO2 or metal-ions (e.g., Fe3+) coupled to solid-phase materials, prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Separation of relatively low abundance phosphopeptides from nonphosphorylated peptides in these types of extremely complex mixtures is essential to maximize coverage of the phosphoproteome. Maintaining acidic conditions during these IMAC or TiO2-based enrichment minimizes the concurrent unwanted binding of highly acidic peptides. However, while peptides containing phosphomonoesters, namely, phosphoserine (pSer), phosphothreonine (pThr), and phosphotyrosine (pTyr), are stable under these acidic binding conditions, phosphopeptides containing acid-labile phosphate group such as phosphohistidine (pHis), are not. Consequently, hydrolysis of these types of phosphopeptides occurs during standard phosphopeptide enrichment, and subsequent phosphosite identification by LC-MS/MS is severely compromised.

In basal cells, there was one major insulin receptor-derived tryptic phosphothreonine peptide and at least four phosphoserine peptides. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) stimulated phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, some of the basal phosphoserine peptides, and at least one phosphoserine peptide that was not detected in the basal state. Staurosporine completely inhibited the PDBU-mediated phosphorylation. Although staurosporine also inhibited basal phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine peptide, down-regulation of PKC did not, suggesting that PKC does not mediate basal insulin receptor phosphorylation. Insulin treatment resulted in the appearance of four phosphotyrosine peptides. It also stimulated the phosphorylation of at least two phosphoserine peptides. One of these may have been a complex of two or more distinct but poorly resolved phosphopeptides, which was seen in basal cells and a component of which seemed to be stimulated by PDBU. However, neither staurosporine nor down-regulation of PKC diminished insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of these peptides, indicating that insulin-stimulated receptor serine phosphorylation did not involve PKC activity.

The nanoelectrospray product ion spectra of multiply charged phosphopeptide anions reveal the occurrence of phosphate-specific high-mass fragment ions of the type [M - nH - 79](n-1)-. These so far unrecognized fragments, which are observed for phosphoserine-, phosphothreonine-, and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, are the counterparts of the established inorganic phosphopeptide marker ion found at m/z 79 = [PO3]-. The high-mass marker ions are formed with high efficiency at moderate collision offset values and are particularly useful for sensitive recognition of pSer-, pThr-, and pTyr-peptides due to the low background level in MS/MS spectra at m/z values above those of the precursor ions. By virtue of this feature, the detection of the new phosphorylation-specific fragment ions appears to be more sensitive than the detection of the low-mass phosphate marker ion at m/z 79, where a higher interference by nonspecific background signals is generally observed. The number of phosphate groups within a phosphopeptide can also be estimated on the basis of the [M - nH - 79](n-1)- ions, since these exhibit an effective, sequential neutral loss of H3PO4 of the residing phosphate groups. A mechanistic explanation for the formation of the [M - nH - 79](n-1)- ions from multiply charged phosphopeptides is given.

Using classical genetics to study modular phosphopeptide-binding domains within a family of proteins that are functionally redundant is difficult when other members of the domain family compensate for the product of the knocked-out gene. Here we describe a chemical genetics approach that overcomes this limitation by using UV-activatable caged phosphopeptides. By incorporating a caged phosphoserine residue within a consensus motif, these reagents simultaneously and synchronously inactivate all phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding domain family members in a rapid and temporally regulated manner.

PPM1D is amplified or Wip1 is overexpressed in several human cancers, and it acts as a weak oncogene. Although inhibition of Wip1 may have therapeutic value, no specific inhibitors are available. In this study, we designed phosphopeptide inhibitors for Wip1 on the basis of its optimal substrate sequence. We found that phosphoserine-containing diphosphorylated peptides with the sequence pSXpY inhibited Wip1 phosphatase activity, whereas phosphothreonine-containing peptides with the sequence pTXpY were physiological substrates. Moreover, the X residue in the pSXpY sequence modulated inhibitor activity, and beta-branched amino acid-substituted (Ile or Val) phosphopeptides showed high inhibitory potencies. A thioether cyclic phosphopeptide c(MpSIpYVA) had a K(i) <1.0 microM.

For large peptides (> or =18 amino acids), the elution time shifts due to single phosphorylation were limited (ranging between -0.48 and +0.03 min), while the elution time shifts for small peptides (<18 amino acids) were characterized by a larger deviation (ranging between -5.28 and +0.59 min).

The abnormally phosphorylated forms of tau factor are major constituents of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. In order to investigate protein phosphatases which are related to dephosphorylation of abnormal phosphorylation sites, we examined the dephosphorylation of tau factor phosphorylated by three proline-directed type protein kinases. Tau factor phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase and tau protein kinase II was dephosphorylated by the holoenzyme of protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin, while either the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A or protein phosphatase 2C could not catalyze the dephosphorylation. From the kinetic analysis, we concluded that tau factors phosphorylated by the protein kinases serve as good substrates for protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin. On the other hand, tau factor phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha was dephosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatases 2A as well as the holoenzyme of protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin. It has been reported that serines 199, 202 and 396 according to the numbering of the longest human tau isoform are among the major abnormal phosphorylation sites of tau factor. We synthesized two phosphopeptides which contained phosphoserines 199 and 202 or phosphoserine 396 and prepared the polyclonal antibodies specific for the phosphopeptides.

Neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain were immunostained with both antibodies but the normal neurons in the normal aged brains were not.

Exhaustive digestion of (32)P-labeled large T antigen with trypsin generated six major phosphopeptides which could be separated in a newly developed isobutyric acid-containing chromatography system. By partial tryptic digestion, large T antigen was cleaved into an amino-terminal fragment of 17,000 daltons and overlapping fragments from the carboxy-terminal region ranging in size between 71,000 and 13,000 daltons.

METHODS: Phosphopeptide immunoprecipitation of six technical replicates corresponding to 10mg protein from HCT116 cells was performed using agarose bead-coupled phosphotyrosine antibodies P-Tyr-1000 (N=3) and 4G10 (N=3). NanoLC-MS/MS was performed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. For relative quantitation of protein phosphorylation, spectral counts of phosphoproteins and ion intensities of phosphopeptides were determined using MaxQuant. RESULTS: From the 3 samples incubated with P-Tyr-1000 a total of 689 phosphopeptides were identified with 60% ID reproducibility. The phosphopeptide capture using 4G10 resulted in a total of 421 at 46% ID reproducibility. The P-Tyr-1000 was applied to EGFR mutated U87 cells. Erlotinib reduced EGFR phosphorylation with 59% at y978, y1125, y1138, y1172, and y1197. EGFR inhibition was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of FYN, MET, PTK2, DYRK1A, MAPK1 and EPHA2. CONCLUSION: The P-Tyr-1000 phosphotyrosine antibody performs superiorly when compared to 4G10 antibody for label-free phosphotyrosine-based phosphoproteomics. This workflow allows evaluation of drug target phosphorylation and may give insights in the pharmacodynamic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the past decade multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been implemented in standard treatment regimens for patients with cancer. Unfortunately the majority of patients develops resistance to these drugs. Reliable tools for analysis of pharmacodynamic effects and drug resistance mechanisms are therefore warranted. Phosphoproteomic analyses have meanwhile emerged as a sophisticated approach for the determination of protein phosphorylation. These analyses rely on antibodies for enrichment of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. Here we compared two commercially available phosphotyrosine antibodies and show that P-Tyr-1000 yields 64% more phosphopeptides than 4G10 antibody, while including almost all 4G10 captured phosphopeptides. The workflow can be reproducibly performed at intermediate protein input levels of 10mg. Furthermore, application of the P-Tyr-1000 antibody in a standardized phosphoproteomics workflow allows relative quantitation of drug target inhibition and provides insights in alternative signaling pathways in cancer cells.

Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was studied in intact well differentiated hepatoma cells (Fao) and in a solubilized and partially purified receptor preparation obtained from these cells by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin agarose. Tryptic peptides containing the phosphorylation sites of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphoamino acid content of these peptides was determined by acid hydrolysis and high voltage electrophoresis. Separation of the phosphopeptides from unstimulated Fao cells revealed one major and two minor phosphoserine-containing peptides and a single minor phosphothreonine-containing peptide. Insulin (10(-7) M) increased the phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor 3- to 4-fold in the intact Fao cell. After insulin stimulation, two phosphotyrosine-containing peptides were identified. Tyrosine phosphorylation reached a steady state within 20 s after the addition of insulin and remained nearly constant for 1 h. Under our experimental conditions, no significant change in the amount of [32P]phosphoserine or [32P]phosphothreonine associated with the beta-subunit was found during the initial response of cells to insulin. When the insulin receptor was extracted from the Fao cells and incubated in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+, very little phosphorylation occurred in the absence of insulin. In this preparation, insulin rapidly stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues only and high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the beta-subunit digested with trypsin revealed one minor and two major phosphopeptides. The elution position of the minor peptide corresponded to that of the major phosphotyrosine-containing peptide obtained from the beta-subunit of the insulin-stimulated receptor labeled in vivo. In contrast, the elution position of one of the major phosphopeptides that occurred during in vitro phosphorylation corresponded to the minor phosphotyrosine-containing peptide phosphorylated in vivo. The other major in vitro phosphotyrosine-containing peptide was not detected in vivo. Our results indicate that: tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor occurs rapidly following insulin binding to intact cells; the level of tyrosine phosphorylation remains constant for up to 1 h; the specificity of the receptor kinase or accessibility of the phosphorylation sites are different in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 88, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 343, "charStart": 90}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 512, "charStart": 345}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 624, "charStart": 514}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 809, "charStart": 626}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 939, "charStart": 811}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1023, "charStart": 941}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1361, "charStart": 1025}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1537, "charStart": 1363}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1791, "charStart": 1539}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1985, "charStart": 1793}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2186, "charStart": 1987}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2272, "charStart": 2188}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2597, "charStart": 2274}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2630, "charStart": 2598}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Kinetics", "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Rats", "Receptor, Insulin", "Trypsin", "Vanadates", "Vanadium"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Gel filtration of the digest through Sephadex G-25 (fine) yielded three fractions, the first containing primarily peptides 1-44 and 45-87, the second peptides 15-44, 88-109, and 110-151, and the third peptides 1-14 and 152-168.

Second, fragmentation spectra of phosphopeptides, in particular those of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing peptides, are often dominated by the loss of the phosphate group(s) and therefore lack the information required to identify the peptide sequence and the site of phosphorylation, and third, sequence database search engines and statistical models for data validation are not optimized for the specific fragmentation properties of phosphorylated peptides.

In vitro studies have shown that OPN can inhibit the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) and other biologically relevant crystal phases, and that this inhibitory activity requires phosphorylation of the protein; however, it is not known which phosphorylated residues are involved. We have synthesized peptides corresponding to four phosphoserine-containing sequences in rat OPN: OPN7-17, containing phosphoserines 10 and 11; OPN41-52, containing phosphoserines 46 and 47; OPN248-264, containing phosphoserines 250, 257 and 262; and OPN290-301, containing phosphoserines 295-297. The abilities of these peptides to inhibit de novo HA formation were determined using a constant-composition autotitration assay. All four OPN phosphopeptides caused a dose-dependent increase in nucleation lag time, but did not significantly affect subsequent formation of the crystals.

Five model phosphopeptides, including three synthetic P-Ser-, P-Thr-, or P-Ser- and P-Thr-containing peptides; a protein kinases C-phosphorylated peptide; and a phosphopeptide derived from beta-casein trypsin digests were modified and then sequenced using an ESI-quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer.

Several methods have been developed to deal with the low sensitivity and specificity of phosphopeptide analysis.

The substitution of the negatively charged phosphate group by a positively charged S-ethylpyridyl group greatly improves the ionisation of the modified peptides, especially in MALDI MS, increasing the sensitivity of the analysis. The modification allows the formation of a unique fragment ion at m/z 106 under mild collisional activation conditions, which can be used for parent (precursor) ion scanning in order to improve both the sensitivity and the selectivity of the analysis.

We developed and compared two approaches for automated validation of phosphopeptide tandem mass spectra identified using database searching algorithms. Phosphopeptide identifications were obtained through SEQUEST searches of a protein database appended with its decoy (reversed sequences). Statistical evaluation and iterative searches were employed to create a high-quality data set of phosphopeptides. Automation of postsearch validation was approached by two different strategies. By using statistical multiple testing, we calculate a p value for each tentative peptide phosphorylation. In a second method, we use a support vector machine (SVM; a machine learning algorithm) binary classifier to predict whether a tentative peptide phosphorylation is true. We show good agreement (85%) between postsearch validation of phosphopeptide/spectrum matches by multiple testing and that from support vector machines. Automatic methods conform very well with manual expert validation in a blinded test. Additionally, the algorithms were tested on the identification of synthetic phosphopeptides. We show that phosphate neutral losses in tandem mass spectra can be used to assess the correctness of phosphopeptide/spectrum matches. An SVM classifier with a radial basis function provided classification accuracy from 95.7% to 96.8% of the positive data set, depending on search algorithm used. Establishing the efficacy of an identification is a necessary step for further postsearch interrogation of the spectra for complete localization of phosphorylation sites. Our current implementation performs validation of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing peptides having one or two phosphorylation sites from data gathered on an ion trap mass spectrometer.

The Xenopus cdk2 gene encodes a 32-kDa protein kinase with sequence similarity to the 34-kDa product of the cdc2 gene. Previous studies have shown that the kinase activity of the protein product of the cdk2 gene oscillates in the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle with a high in M-phase and a low in interphase. In the present study cdk2 was found not to be associated with any newly synthesized proteins during the cell cycle, but the enzyme did undergo periodic changes in phosphorylation. Upon exit from metaphase, cdk2 became increasingly phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine residues, and labeling on these residues increased progressively until entry into mitosis, when tyrosine residues were markedly dephosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping of cdk2 demonstrated the major sites of phosphorylation were in a phosphopeptide with a pI of 3.7 that contained both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. This phosphopeptide accumulated in egg extracts blocked in S-phase with aphidicolin and was not evident in cdc2 immunoprecipitated under the same conditions. Under the same conditions cdc2 was phosphorylated primarily on a phosphopeptide containing both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues, most likely threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Affinity-purified human GST-cdc25 was able to dephosphorylate and activate cdk2 isolated from interphase cells. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the phosphate was specifically removed from the same phosphopeptide identified as the major in vivo site of phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that cdk2 is regulated in the cell cycle by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on both serine and tyrosine residues. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation of cdk2 in aphidicolin-blocked extracts and the ability of cdc25 to mediate cdk2 dephosphorylation in vitro suggest the possibility that cdk2 is part of the mechanism ensuring mitosis is not initiated until completion of DNA replication.

Without insulin, the receptor contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine and could be immunoprecipitated with anti-receptor antibody but not with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After incubation of these cells with insulin, both antibodies immunoprecipitated the phosphorylated receptor.

Sequential immunoprecipitation of receptor with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by precipitation of the remaining proteins with anti-receptor antibody suggests that insulin receptors which contain phosphoserine in the basal state are tyrosine phosphorylated more slowly than the dephosphorylated receptors or not at all after the addition of insulin. The beta-subunit of the insulin receptor was the major phosphorylated protein precipitated by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from insulin-stimulated Fao cells.

Phosphorylation of plasma membrane proteins frequently initiates signal transduction pathways or attenuate plasma membrane transport processes. Because of the low abundance and hydrophobic features of many plasma membrane proteins and the low stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation, studies of the plasma membrane phosphoproteome are challenging. We present an optimized analytical strategy for plasma membrane phosphoproteomics that combines efficient plasma membrane protein preparation with TiO(2)-based phosphopeptide enrichment and high-performance mass spectrometry for phosphopeptide sequencing. We used sucrose centrifugation in combination with sodium carbonate extraction to achieve efficient and reproducible purification of low microgram levels of plasma membrane proteins from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs, 10(7) cells), achieving more than 70% yield of membrane proteins. Phosphopeptide enrichment by titanium dioxide chromatography followed by capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allowed us to assign 703 unique phosphorylation sites in 376 phosphoproteins. Our experiments revealed that treatment of cell cultures with three different types of protein phosphatase inhibitors produces distinct phosphopeptide populations and an increase of 10-40% of the number of detected and sequenced phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine containing peptides. In summary, our analytical strategy enables functional phosphoproteomic analysis of stem cell differentiation and cell surface biomarker discovery using very low amounts of starting material.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 112, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 256, "charStart": 114}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 461, "charStart": 258}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 717, "charStart": 463}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1007, "charStart": 719}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1215, "charStart": 1009}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1517, "charStart": 1217}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1709, "charStart": 1519}], "mesh": ["Cell Line", "Cell Membrane", "Chromatography", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry", "Titanium"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

In vitro transcription by vesicular stomatitis virus nucleocapsids is inhibited by enzymatic dephosphorylation of the NS protein. We provide evidence that specific, partial dephosphorylation of NS molecules is the only detectable change in nucleocapsids treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase under conditions that prevent the action of adventitious protease. Dephosphorylation appeared to affect only the rate of transcription; there were no changes in sedimentation rates of transcripts. To identify the sites of phosphorylation required for NS activity in transcription, we examined phosphopeptides produced by chymotrypsin digestion of the two electrophoretic classes of NS molecules found in virions and infected cells. The electrophoretically slower class, NS1, abundant in the intracellular soluble pool, has a lower activity in transcription; it contained six chymotryptic phosphopeptides. Five of these peptides contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, indicating that this peptide cluster represents at least 11 separate sites of phosphorylation. In the electrophoretically faster nucleocapsid-associated NS2 class of molecules, which support a higher rate of transcription, another group of eight phosphopeptides was superimposed on this pattern. Two of these peptides contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, so this cluster of peptides represents at least 10 additional phosphorylation sites. These sites were especially sensitive to dephosphorylation by bacterial alkaline phosphatase.

Phosphorylation is one of the most important PTMs and is estimated to occur on 30% of the mammalian proteome. Its perturbed regulation has been implicated in many pathologies. The rarity of phosphotyrosine compared with phosphoserine or phosphothreonine is prompting the development of more sensitive approaches because proteomic technologies that are currently used to assess tyrosine phosphorylation in proteins are inadequate, identifying only a fraction of the predicted tyrosine phosphoproteome. Here we describe the development of a reproducible, high-sensitivity methodology for the detection and mapping of phosphotyrosine residues by MS. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was coupled covalently to super para-magnetic beads or by affinity to super para-magnetic beads with protein G covalently attached. Using this approach, we successfully enriched phosphotyrosine peptides mixed with non-phosphorylated peptides at a ratio of up to 1:200, enabling detection at a level representing the highest sensitivity reported for tyrosine phosphorylation. The beads were subsequently used to enrich tyrosine phosphopeptides from a digest of the in vitro-phosphorylated recombinant beta-intracellular region of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, which was subsequently analysed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS.
