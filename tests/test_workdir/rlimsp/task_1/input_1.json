We here report on an alternative approach for pY-peptide enrichment using inexpensive pY-imprinted polymer (pY-MIP). We assessed by mass spectrometry the performance of pY-MIP for enrichment and sequencing of phosphopeptides obtained by tryptic digestion of protein extracts from HeLa cells. The combination of pY-MIP- and TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment provided more than 90% selectivity for phosphopeptides. Mass spectrometry signal intensities were enhanced for most pY-phosphopeptides (approximately 70%) when using the pY-MIP-TiO2 combination as compared to TiO2 alone. pY constituted up to 8% of the pY-MIP-TiO2-enriched phosphopeptide fractions.

In a cell-free system, BIRK is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues by protein kinase C (PKC) purified from rat brain. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of PKC-phosphorylated BIRK identified one phosphothreonine and three phosphoserine peptides, which were also in tryptic digests of insulin receptors from insulin- or PMA-treated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the HIR. After Lys-C proteolysis of PKC-phosphorylated BIRK, radioactive phosphopeptides were purified on a C8 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column. Amino acid sequence analysis identified a phosphothreonine peptide corresponding to amino acids 1331-1340 of the HIR.

SH2 (src-homology 2) domains define a newly recognized binding motif that mediates the physical association of target phosphotyrosyl proteins with downstream effector enzymes.

Notably, phosphoprotein association with the SH2 domains of p85 also stimulates an increase in catalytic activity of the PI 3-kinase p110 subunit, which can be mimicked by phosphopeptides corresponding to targeted phosphoprotein phosphorylation sites. To investigate how phosphoprotein binding to the p85 SH2 domain stimulates p110 catalytic activation, we have examined the differential effects of phosphotyrosine and PDGF receptor-, IRS-1- and c-Src-derived phosphopeptides on the conformation of an isolated SH2 domain of PI 3-kinase. Although phosphotyrosine and both activating and non-activating phosphopeptides bind to the SH2 domain, activating phosphopeptides bind with higher affinity and induce a qualitatively distinct conformational change as monitored by CD and NMR spectroscopy. Amide proton exchange and protease protection assays further show that high affinity, specific phosphopeptide binding induces non-local dynamic SH2 domain stabilization.

The increasing use of multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS and MS (3)) methods for comprehensive phosphoproteome analysis studies, as well as the emerging application of in silico spectral intensity prediction algorithms in enhanced database search analysis strategies, necessitate the development of an improved understanding of the mechanisms and other factors that affect the gas-phase fragmentation reactions of phosphorylated peptide ions. To address this need, we have examined the multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) behavior of a set of singly and doubly charged phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptide ions, as well as their regioselectively or uniformly deuterated derivatives, in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Consistent with previous reports, the neutral loss of phosphoric acid (H 3PO 4) was observed as a dominant reaction pathway upon MS/MS. The magnitude of this loss was found to be highly dependent on the proton mobility of the precursor ion for both phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptides.

In this strategy, we postulate that any or all of the potential sites of phosphorylation in a given protein may be phosphorylated. Using this assumption, we calculate the m/z values of all the corresponding singly charged phosphopeptide ions that could, in theory, be produced by the enzyme employed for proteolysis. We test ions at these m/z values for the presence of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues using tandem mass spectrometry (MS(2)) in a vacuum MALDI ion trap mass spectrometer, where the neutral loss of the elements of H(3)PO(4) (98 Da) provides a sensitive assay for the presence of phosphopeptides. Subsequent MS(3) analysis of the (M + H - 98)(+) peaks allows us to confirm or reject the hypotheses that the putative phosphopeptides are present in the sample.

In order to investigate gas-phase fragmentation reactions of phosphorylated peptide ions, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra were recorded from synthetic phosphopeptides and from phosphopeptides isolated from natural sources. MALDI-TOF/TOF (TOF: time-of-flight) spectra of synthetic arginine-containing phosphopeptides revealed a significant increase of y ions resulting from bond cleavages on the C-terminal side of phosphothreonine or phosphoserine. The same effect was found in ESI-MS/MS spectra recorded from the singly charged but not from the doubly charged ions of these phosphopeptides. ESI-MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphopeptides containing two arginine residues support the following general fragmentation rule: Increased amide bond cleavage on the C-terminal side of phosphorylated serines or threonines mainly occurs in peptide ions which do not contain mobile protons. In MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra of phosphopeptides displaying N-terminal fragment ions, abundant b-H(3)PO(4) ions resulting from the enhanced dissociation of the pSer/pThr-X bond were detected (X denotes amino acids). Cleavages at phosphoamino acids were found to be particularly predominant in spectra of phosphopeptides containing pSer/pThr-Pro bonds. A quantitative evaluation of a larger set of MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra recorded from phosphopeptides indicated that phosphoserine residues in arginine-containing peptides increase the signal intensities of the respective y ions by almost a factor of 3. A less pronounced cleavage-enhancing effect was observed in some lysine-containing phosphopeptides without arginine.

Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are found in a variety of signaling proteins and bind phosphotyrosine-containing peptide sequences. To explore the binding properties of the SH2 domain of the Src protein kinase, we used immobilized phosphopeptides to bind purified glutathione S-transferase-Src SH2 fusion proteins. With this assay, as well as a free-peptide competition assay, we have estimated the affinities of the Src SH2 domain for various phosphopeptides relative to a Src SH2-phosphopeptide interaction whose Kd has been determined previously (YEEI-P; Kd = 4 nM). Two Src-derived phosphopeptides, one containing the regulatory C-terminal Tyr-527 and another containing the autophosphorylation site Tyr-416, bind the Src SH2 domain in a specific though low-affinity manner (with about 10(4)-lower affinity than the YEEI-P peptide). A platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) phosphopeptide containing Tyr-857 does not bind appreciably to the Src SH2 domain, suggesting it is not the PDGF-R binding site for Src as previously reported. However, another PDGF-R-derived phosphopeptide containing Tyr-751 does bind the Src SH2 domain (with an affinity approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of YEEI-P). All of the phosphopeptides which bind to the Src SH2 domain contain a glutamic acid at position -3 or -4 with respect to phosphotyrosine; changing this residue to alanine greatly diminishes binding. We have also tested Src SH2 mutants for their binding properties and have interpreted our results in light of the recent crystal structure solution for the Src SH2 domain. Mutations in various conserved and nonconserved residues (R155A, R155K, N198E, H201R, and H201L) cause slight reductions in binding, while two mutations cause severe reductions. The W148E mutant domain, which alters the invariant tryptophan that marks the N-terminal border of the SH2 domain, binds poorly to phosphopeptides. Inclusion of the SH3 domain in the fusion protein partially restores the binding by the W148E mutant. A change in the invariant arginine that coordinates twice with phosphotyrosine in the peptide (R175L) results in a nearly complete loss of binding. The R175L mutant does display high affinity for the PDGF-R peptide containing Tyr-751, via an interaction that is at least partly phosphotyrosine independent. We have used this interaction to show that the R175L mutation also disrupts the intramolecular interaction between the Src SH2 domain and the phosphorylated C terminus within the context of the entire Src protein; thus, the binding properties observed for mutant domains in an in vitro assay appear to mimic those that occur in vivo.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 121, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 250, "charStart": 123}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 433, "charStart": 252}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 688, "charStart": 435}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 955, "charStart": 690}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1166, "charStart": 957}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1343, "charStart": 1168}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1542, "charStart": 1345}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1714, "charStart": 1544}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1892, "charStart": 1716}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2040, "charStart": 1894}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2142, "charStart": 2042}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2290, "charStart": 2144}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2449, "charStart": 2292}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2783, "charStart": 2451}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Binding, Competitive", "Conserved Sequence", "In Vitro Techniques", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

This side reaction resulted in the introduction of the affinity tag into unphosphorylated proteins, confounding attempts to specifically purify phosphoproteins from mixtures. Unchecked, this side reaction will also prevent application of the beta-elimination strategy to phosphopeptide samples where the phosphorylated species are minor components (i.e., most current phosphoproteomics applications). Quantitation of the side reaction products using three synthetic unphosphorylated peptides showed varying conversion efficiencies; at maximum, 1.7% of unphosphorylated peptide was converted to the affinity-tagged form. Inclusion of EDTA into the reaction reduced the side reaction but also greatly reduced the conversion efficiency of one of the phosphoserine residues of ovalbumin, suggesting a role for trace metal ions in the beta-elimination chemistry.

These competing pathways produce product ions with different structures but the same m/z values, potentially limiting the utility of CID-MS(3) for phosphorylation site localization.

The cell-permeable diacylglycerol, sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), is shown to mimic the effect of tumor promoting phorbol diesters on epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding and action in intact cells. DiC8 inhibited the binding of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate to A431 cell monolayers indicating that the diacylglycerol interacts with the phorbol diester receptor. At 0.3 microM, DiC8 half-maximally inhibited the high affinity binding of 125I-EGF to A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Scatchard analysis indicated that the inhibition of 125I-EGF binding was very similar to that observed in the presence of 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA). DiC8 also mimicked the action of PMA to increase the phosphorylation state of the EGF receptor in 32P-labeled cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that DiC8 and PMA caused an increase in the level of EGF-receptor phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, whereas EGF caused an increase in the level of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Phosphopeptide mapping of the EGF receptor showed that DiC8 and PMA enhanced the phosphorylation of the same tryptic peptides. DiC8 inhibited the EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in A431 cells in a similar manner to that observed with PMA.

The clinical outcome of Helicobacter pylori infections is determined by multiple host-pathogen interactions that may develop to chronic gastritis, and sometimes peptic ulcers or gastric cancer. Highly virulent strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that delivers the effector protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA-sequence motifs, called A, B and C in Western-type strains, by members of the oncogenic Src and Abl host kinases. Phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs mediate interactions of CagA with host signaling factors--in particular various SH2-domain containing human proteins--thereby hijacking multiple downstream signaling cascades. Observations of tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA are mainly based on the use of commercial phosphotyrosine antibodies, which originally were selected to detect phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. Systematic studies of phosphorylated EPIYA-motif detection by the different antibodies would be very useful, but are not yet available. To address this issue, we synthesized phospho- and non-phosphopeptides representing each predominant Western CagA EPIYA-motif, and determined the recognition patterns of seven different phosphotyrosine antibodies in Western blots, and also performed infection studies with diverse representative Western H. pylori strains. Our results show that a total of 9-11 amino acids containing the phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs are necessary and sufficient for specific detection by these antibodies, but revealed great variability in sequence recognition.

As with virus mutated at the first cysteine residue, mutation of the second cysteine (C97) within the motif resulted in a marked reduction in viral growth and attenuation of cytopathogenicity in infected cell cultures. However, mutagenesis of this second cysteine only reduced phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity to 70 % of that of wild-type VP2, but increased phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase activity by as much as 700 %.

The dShc PTB domain appeared similar to the insulin-like receptor substrate-1 PTB domain in secondary structure as suggested by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Surface plasmon resonance measurements indicated that the dShc PTB domain bound with high affinity to phosphopeptides (Der) derived from the Tyr1228 site of the DER receptor. The kinetics of the dShc PTB domain-Der phosphopeptide interaction differed from those of a typical SH2 domain-ligand interaction, in that the PTB domain displayed slower on/off rates. Competition binding assays using truncated versions of the Der peptides revealed that high affinity binding to the dShc PTB domain requires, in addition to the NPXpY motif, the presence of hydrophobic residues at both positions -5 and -7 relative to phosphotyrosine. The dShc PTB domain showed a similar binding specificity to the human Shc (hShc) PTB domain, but subtle differences were noted; such that the hShc PTB domain bound preferentially to a phosphopeptide from the mammalian nerve growth factor receptor, whereas the dShc PTB domain bound preferentially to phosphopeptides from the Drosophila DER receptor. The invertebrate dShc PTB domain therefore possesses a binding specificity for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides that is optimally suited for recognition of the activated DER receptor.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 84, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 335, "charStart": 86}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 445, "charStart": 337}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 614, "charStart": 447}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 789, "charStart": 616}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 974, "charStart": 791}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1241, "charStart": 976}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1591, "charStart": 1243}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1775, "charStart": 1593}], "mesh": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Binding, Competitive", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "ErbB Receptors", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Phosphotyrosine", "Protein Kinases", "Proteins", "Receptors, Invertebrate Peptide", "Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The B cell-restricted transmembrane glycoprotein CD22 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor, thereby generating phosphotyrosine motifs in the cytoplasmic domain which recruit intracellular effector proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains. By virtue of its interaction with these effector proteins CD22 modulates signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor. To define further the molecular mechanism by which CD22 mediates its co-receptor function, phosphopeptide mapping experiments were conducted to determine which of the six tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are involved in recruitment of the stimulatory effector proteins phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, and Syk. The results obtained indicate that the protein tyrosine kinase Syk interacts with multiple CD22-derived phosphopeptides in both immunoprecipitation and reverse Far Western assays. In contrast, the Grb2.Sos complex was observed to bind exclusively to the fourth phosphotyrosine motif (Y828ENV) from CD22 and does so via a direct interaction based on Far Western and reverse Far Western blotting. Although both PLCgamma and PI3K were observed to bind to multiple phosphopeptides in precipitation experiments, subsequent studies using reverse Far Western blot analysis demonstrated that only the carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide of CD22 (Y863VTL) binds directly to either one.

Despite major advances in mass spectrometry, the detection of phosphopeptides by liquid chromatography with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/ES-MS) still remains very challenging in proteomics analysis. Phosphopeptides do not protonate efficiently due to the presence of one or more acidic phosphate groups, making their detection difficult. However, other mechanisms also contribute to the difficulties in phosphopeptide analysis by LC/ES-MS. We report here on one such undocumented problem: the formation of phosphopeptide-metal ion complexes during LC/ES-MS. It is demonstrated that both synthetic phosphopeptides and phosphopeptides from bovine beta-casein and alpha-casein form phosphopeptide-metal ion complexes containing iron and aluminum ions, resulting in a dramatic decrease in signal intensity of the protonated phosphopeptides. The interaction of phosphopeptides with metal ions on the surface of the C18 stationary phase is also shown to alter their chromatographic behavior on reversed-phase columns such that the phosphopeptides, especially multiply phosphorylated peptides, become strongly retained and very difficult to elute. The sources of iron and aluminum are from the solvents, stainless steel, glassware and C18 material. It was also found that, upon addition of EDTA, the formation of the phosphopeptide-metal ion complex is diminished, and the phosphopeptides that did not elute from the LC column can now be detected efficiently as protonated molecules.

The regulation of kinase activity associated with insulin receptor by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been examined using partially purified receptor immobilized on insulin-agarose. The immobilized receptor preparation exhibits predominately tyrosine but also serine and threonine kinase activities toward insulin receptor beta subunit and exogenous histone. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP, followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP, results in a progressive activation of the receptor kinase activity when assayed in the presence of histone and [gamma-32P]ATP. A maximal 4-fold activation is achieved by prior incubation of receptor with concentrations of ATP approaching 1 mM. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of tryptic hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled insulin receptor beta subunit reveals three domains of phosphorylation (designated peaks 1, 2, and 3). Phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues are present in these three domains while peak 2 contains phosphothreonine as well. Thus, at least seven sites are available for phosphorylation on the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Incubation of the phosphorylated insulin receptor with alkaline phosphatase at 15 degrees C results in the selective dephosphorylation of the phosphotyrosine residues on the beta subunit of the receptor while the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine contents are not affected. The dephosphorylation of the receptor is accompanied by a marked 65% inhibition of the receptor kinase activity. Almost 90% of the decrease in [32P]phosphate content of the receptor after alkaline phosphatase treatment is accounted for by a decrease in phosphotyrosine content in peak 2, while very small decreases are observed in peaks 1 and 3, respectively.

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain subunit of smooth muscle myosin (LC20) by the calcium-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C regulates contraction of chemically-permeabilized (glycerinated) porcine carotid artery smooth muscle. Purified protein kinase C and oleic acid were used to phosphorylate LC20 in glycerinated muscles in the presence of a CaEGTA/EGTA buffer system (pCa 8) to prevent activation of myosin light chain kinase. Phosphorylation of the light chain to 1.3 mol of PO4/mol of LC20 did not stimulate contraction. Tryptic digests of glycerinated carotid artery LC20 contained two major phosphopeptides which contained phosphoserine but not phosphothreonine. Incubation of glycerinated muscles with calcium (20 microM) and calmodulin (10 microM) resulted in contraction and LC20 phosphorylation to 1.1 mol of PO4/mol of LC20; tryptic digests of LC20 from these muscles contained a single phosphopeptide which could be distinguished by phosphopeptide mapping from the two phosphopeptides derived from muscles phosphorylated with protein kinase C. Further phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated muscles to 2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20, by incubation with protein kinase C, had no effect on either the level of isometric force or the lightly-loaded shortening velocity (after-load = 0.1 peak active force); removal of Ca2+ and calmodulin, but not protein kinase C and oleic acid, resulted in normal relaxation in spite of maintained phosphorylation to 1.2 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. Comparison of LC20 phosphopeptide maps from glycerinated muscles incubated with protein kinase C plus Ca2+/calmodulin (2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) to maps from intact muscles stimulated with 10(-6) M phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (0.05 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) showed that the same three phosphopeptides were present in both the intact and glycerinated muscles. These findings show that phosphorylation of LC20 by protein kinase C in glycerinated muscles to levels at least 40 times higher than those present during contraction of intact, phorbol ester-stimulated muscles does not activate contraction nor does it significantly modify the contraction of smooth muscle which occurs in response to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of Ser19 by myosin light chain kinase.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 134, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 445, "charStart": 136}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 649, "charStart": 447}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 745, "charStart": 651}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 889, "charStart": 747}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1711, "charStart": 891}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 2067, "charStart": 1713}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 2486, "charStart": 2069}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Autoradiography", "Brain", "Carotid Arteries", "Guinea Pigs", "In Vitro Techniques", "Isometric Contraction", "Kinetics", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Myosin Subfragments", "Peptide Mapping", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C", "Swine"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis of RAF-1 reveals the presence of phosphoserine, trace amounts of phosphothreonine but no phosphotyrosine and the phosphorylated RAF-1 does not react with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies.

Furthermore, coprecipitation experiments failed to reveal any noncovalent association of RAF-1 with the CSF-1 receptor.

Phosphorylation of p95 was prominent in embryos of early developmental stage. Hydrolysis of p95 phosphoprotein yielded phosphotyrosine in addition to phosphothreonine and phosphoserine. Native p95 was also tyrosine-phosphorylated. p95 phosphoprotein was purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and the amino acid sequence was determined.

The influence of tyrosine and o-phosphotyrosine on the transfer of electrons to nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT) was studied. Tyrosine phosphate was found to strongly promote the transfer of electrons from ferrous iron to NBT, while tyrosine was inhibitory. The enhancement of NBT reduction by tyrosine phosphate was blocked by superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results suggest a role for phosphorylated tyrosine residues to promote intracellular redox reactions. We suggest that the role of tyrosine protein kinases in cell proliferation and transformation may be to regulate electron transport in as yet undefined cellular systems.
