Reversible phosphorylation is important for G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, desensitization, and endocytosis, yet the precise location and role of in vivo phosphorylation sites is unknown for most receptors. This chapter describes a powerful analytical method for the direct identification of GPCR phosphorylation sites by two-dimensional (2D) phosphopeptide mapping. The GPCR of interest is isolated from 32P-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. In situ cleavage by trypsin releases phosphopeptides that are separated by a combination of high-voltage electrophoresis and chromatography. Phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman sequencing of isolated phosphopeptides reveals information that can lead to the direct identification of GPCR phosphorylation sites.

Because many 14-3-3 interactions are phosphorylation-dependent, 14-3-3 has been tightly integrated into the core phospho-regulatory pathways that are crucial for normal growth and development and that often become dysregulated in human disease states such as cancer. This review examines the recent advances that further elucidate the role of 14-3-3 proteins as integrators of diverse signaling cues that influence cell fate decisions and tumorigenesis.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 103, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 353, "charStart": 105}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 483, "charStart": 355}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 750, "charStart": 485}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 937, "charStart": 752}], "mesh": ["14-3-3 Proteins", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Lineage", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Signal Transduction", "beta Catenin"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}

On-plate enrichment of phosphopeptide digests followed by MALDI-MS is attractive for analyzing small quantities of phosphoproteins because it involves minimal sample handling and reduces sample loss. This work describes a method for modification of Si wafers, which serve as MALDI plates, with 250 microm-diameter microspots of phosphopeptide-binding polymer brushes enclosed by a hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer. Formation of the patterned surface occurs by heating a patterned PDMS stamp on a Si wafer, growing the polymer brushes from the Si exposed in the stamp pores, and removing the stamp to leave behind a residual layer of PDMS surrounding the brushes. Pinning and evaporation of a sample droplet on the microspot concentrate samples and enrich phosphopeptides through binding to the small area. After rinsing with acidic solution to remove unwanted peptides, a drop of matrix solution elutes the phosphopeptides and crystallizes only on the microspot. With beta-casein and ovalbumin digests, the use of microspots rather than 2 mm-diameter polymer spots for phosphopeptide enrichment results in a 5-fold decrease in MALDI-MS detection limits and low-femtomole level sensitivity. Improved enrichment of phosphopeptides on the polymer microspots from samples that contain a 10-fold molar excess of peptides from a non-phosphorylated protein digest is also possible with the help of a sonication-assisted rinse.

Heat stress drastically increased phosphopeptide signals. To identify target peptides and amino acids and to correlate phosphorylation and transactivation function, phosphopeptide maps were produced of LexA-human HSF1 chimeras and mutant derivatives thereof, and transactivation activities of original and mutant chimeras were compared.

The patterns of phosphopeptides of LexA-HSF1 and endogenous HSF1 were similar.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a well-established approach for quantifying thousands of phosphorylation events in a single experiment. We designed a peptide internal standard-based assay directed toward sample preparation strategies for mass spectrometry analysis to understand better phosphopeptide recovery from enrichment strategies.

Our assay provides data on the recovery of phosphopeptides, which complement other metrics, namely the number of identified phosphopeptides and enrichment specificity.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins is a common regulatory mechanism, although it accounts for less than 1% of the total O-phosphate content in proteins. Whereas aromatic phosphorylation sites can be identified by a number of different analytical techniques, sequence analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins at the low picomole or even femtomole level is still a challenging task. This paper describes the post-source decay in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of phosphotyrosine-containing model peptides by comparing their fragmentation behavior with sequence-homologous unphosphorylated peptides. Whereas the parent ions showed significant losses of HPO3, all phosphorylated fragment ions of the b- and y-series displayed only minor dephosphorylated signals, which often were not detectable. Surprisingly, one of the studied phosphotyrosine-containing sequences displayed, in addition to the [M + H - 80]+ ion, a more abundant [M + H - 98]+ ion, which could be explained by elimination of phosphoric acid. This dephosphorylation pattern was very similar to the patterns obtained for phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptides. Because the dephosphorylation pattern of the parent ion is often used to identify modified amino acids in peptides, we investigated possible dephosphorylation mechanisms in detail. Therefore, we substituted single trifunctional amino acid residues and incorporated deuterated phosphotyrosine residues. After excluding direct elimination of phosphoric acid from tyrosine, we could show that the obtained loss of H3PO4 depends on aspartic acid and arginine residues. Most likely the HPO3 group is transferred to aspartic acid followed by cleavage of phosphoric acid forming a succinimide. On the other hand, arginine appears to induce the H3PO4 loss by protonation of phosphotyrosine leaving a phenyl cation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 143, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 310, "charStart": 145}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 545, "charStart": 312}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 792, "charStart": 547}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 987, "charStart": 794}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1201, "charStart": 989}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1335, "charStart": 1203}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1516, "charStart": 1337}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1637, "charStart": 1518}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1800, "charStart": 1639}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1922, "charStart": 1802}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2042, "charStart": 1924}], "mesh": ["Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphotyrosine", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

{"text": "Phosphopeptide enrichment with cross-linked Os(II)(dmebpy)2 Cl-derivatized acrylamide and vinylimidazole copolymer. RATIONALE: Reversible phosphorylation of proteins catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases plays a key regulatory role in intracellular biological processes. Protein phosphorylation profiling is still a challenge due to its low stoichiometry, diversity of phosphorylated protein forms, and dynamic nature of phosphorylation states. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been widely used for the characterization of protein phosphorylation, due to its high sensitivity and MS/MS sequencing capability. However, the low abundance and ionization efficiency of phosphorylated peptides and interference from their non-phosphorylated counterparts and other peptides in the enzymatic digests of proteins complicate the localization of phosphorylation sites in liquid chromatography (LC)/MS analysis. So the enrichment of phosphopeptides from the digests is often required before LC/MS. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) are the two most commonly used enrichment techniques for phosphopeptides prior to MS analysis. METHODS: Cross-linked Os(II)(4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine)2 Cl-derivatized acrylamide and vinylimidazole copolymer were applied for the enrichment of phosphopeptides. RESULTS: Under neutral loading buffer conditions phosphopeptides bind on the Os-polymer without nonspecific binding of acidic peptides. Differential binding of monophosphorylated and multiply phosphorylated peptides can be achieved under different concentrations of imidazole. Sequential elution of bound phosphopeptides can be obtained with elution buffers of different pH values below 3. The loading buffers with imidazole can be aqueous or 7/3 H2 O/ACN. Once phosphopeptides bind onto the Os-polymer, washing with water, 0.1% acetic acid (pH\u00a0~\u00a03) or 1/1 H2 O/ACN 0.05% acetic acid (pH ~3) does not elute phosphopeptides. The Os-polymer does not show bias of binding and elution toward phosphopeptide standards with singly, doubly and triply phosphorylated sites. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-linked Os(II)(dimethylbipyridine)2 Cl-derivatized poly(acrylamide)-poly(vinylimidazole) copolymer is proven to be a new efficient IMAC resin for phosphopeptide enrichment and shows some unique properties for differential binding and sequential elution of phosphopeptides.

Phosphorylation is a post-translational modification of proteins that plays very important role in a large number of biological processes. However, despite recent advancements in phosphoproteome research, large-scale detection and characterization of phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry (MS) is still a challenging task due to the low abundance of phosphopeptides and sub-stoichiometric nature of phosphorylation sites. On-particle microwave-assisted trypsin digestion of phosphoproteins and enrichment of phosphopeptides is an effective method for identification/characterization of phosphopeptides. Magnetic nanoparticles typically can absorb microwave radiation and generate heat in order to resolve complex phosphproteins and to enhance the digestion rate and capture the phosphopeptides on their modified surfaces. In this study, we used a cheap and efficient method for rapid microwave-assisted tryptic digestion of phosphoproteins and simultaneous enrichment of phosphopeptides using CoFe2 O4 -ZnO magnetic nanoparticles. Using this technique, the digestion time of phosphoproteins can be reduced and the phosphopeptides can be quickly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). For the first time, we have applied CoFe2 O4 -ZnO magnetic nanoparticles for enrichment of phosphopeptides from standard phosphoproteins (\u03b2-casein and ovalbumin), complex samples (human serum and egg white) and a protein mixture of \u03b2-casein and BSA (1:100). Our results demonstrate that the capture efficiency of CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles for \u03b2-casein and ovalbumin in MALDI-TOFMS is very high (detection limits 0.2 fmol and 20 fmol, respectively). The CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles have high affinity for phosphopeptide enrichment for \u03b2-casein in complex mixtures with BSA at 1:10 and 1:100 molar ratios in the microwave within 30 s. Compared with other reported magnetic nanoparticles, the CoFe2 O4 -ZnO nanoparticles are easy to prepare and handle, and can save time in the phosphopeptide enrichment procedure, making these nanoparticle a good choice for highly sensitive phosphopeptide enrichment.

The mass spectrometric analysis of protein phosphorylation is still far from being routine, and the outcomes thereof are often unsatisfying.

Over the past years, phosphoproteomics has advanced to a prime tool in signaling research.

Yet, we still face the problem of how to achieve correct modification site localization. Here we use alternative fragmentation and different bioinformatics approaches for the identification and confident localization of phosphorylation sites. Phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed by multistage activation, collision-induced dissociation and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), yielding complementary phosphopeptide identifications. We further found that MASCOT, OMSSA and Andromeda each identified a distinct set of phosphopeptides allowing the number of site assignments to be increased.

Nonenzymatic post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is a fundamental molecular process of aging. The combination of various modifications and their accumulation with age not only affects function, but leads to crosslinking and protein aggregation. In this study, aged human lens proteins were examined using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry and a blind PTM search strategy. Multiple thioether modifications of Ser and Thr residues by glutathione (GSH) and its metabolites were unambiguously identified. Thirty-four of 36 sites identified on 15 proteins were found on known phosphorylation sites, supporting a mechanism involving dehydroalanine (DHA) and dehydrobutyrine (DHB) formation through \u03b2-elimination of phosphoric acid from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine with subsequent nucleophilic attack by GSH. In vitro incubations of phosphopeptides demonstrated that this process can occur spontaneously under physiological conditions. Evidence that this mechanism can also lead to protein-protein crosslinks within cells is provided where five crosslinked peptides were detected in a human cataractous lens.

{"docId": "9383377", "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 64}, "text": "The phosphopeptide-binding specificity of Src family SH2 domains. BACKGROUND: Src homology 2 (SH2) domains mediate protein/protein interactions by binding phosphotyrosyl proteins with high specificity. The protein Lck, a Src-like lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase which is important in signals involved in T-cell development, contains one such domain. The crystal structure of a complex of the Lck SH2 domain with a high-affinity ligand, pY324, is known. This ligand has the sequence EPQpYEEIPIYL. RESULTS: We designed and synthesized a series of phosphopeptides with single amino-acid changes in the four residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) in pY324. Surprisingly, the Glu one residue C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (at position pY + 1) is sensitive to substitution, whereas the Ile at position pY + 3 is much less sensitive, accommodating a Glu with only modest loss of binding affinity. Replacement of the Glu and Pro on either side of the Ile had little effect, as predicted. Truncated phosphopeptides that end at position pY + 5 and have only an acetyl group N-terminal to the pTyr bound with only slightly lower affinity than pY324. In addition, naturally occurring phosphopeptide sequences that span a 1,000-fold range in binding affinity for the Lck SH2 domain have been identified. CONCLUSIONS: The Lck SH2 domain is highly selective for phosphotyrosyl-peptide binding; its specificity is dictated by the first and third residues C-terminal to the pTyr. The unexpected effects of some amino-acid substitutions indicate that the interactions seen between SH2 domains and ligand in the crystal structure may not be identical to those that occur in solution.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 64, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 200, "charStart": 66}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 352, "charStart": 202}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 455, "charStart": 354}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 498, "charStart": 457}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 666, "charStart": 500}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 907, "charStart": 668}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 997, "charStart": 909}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1156, "charStart": 999}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1308, "charStart": 1158}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1480, "charStart": 1310}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1682, "charStart": 1482}], "mesh": ["Crystallography, X-Ray", "Genes, src", "Humans", "Phosphopeptides", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The low abundance of many of these molecules and the potentially low stoichiometry of phosphorylation means that conventional analytical techniques are incapable of identifying specific sites of modification inducible in vivo. The most common technique used is two-dimensional (2D) phosphopeptide mapping (electrophoresis, thin-layer chromatography) of peptides derived by proteolysis of a phosphoprotein.

We demonstrate that the chemical composition of phosphopeptides is not altered during the 2D mapping procedure. By detailed analysis of the sites of phosphorylation induced in vitro on CD3-zeta by p56lck we demonstrate that interpretation of the sites of phosphorylation based on 2D phosphopeptide mapping alone is difficult.

Incomplete recovery from the LC column is identified as a major cause for poor detection efficiency of phosphopeptides by LC-MS/MS.

This may result in their partial or even complete retention. Addition of phosphate, EDTA or citrate to the phosphopeptide sample was tested to overcome the detrimental phosphopeptide suppression during gradient LC-MS/MS analysis, while the standard solvent composition (water, acetonitrile, formic acid) of the LC system was left unchanged. With the use of UPLC, a citrate additive was found to be highly effective in increasing the phosphopeptide detection sensitivity. Addition of EDTA was found to be comparable with respect to sensitivity enhancement, but led to fast clogging and destruction of the spray needle and analytical columns due to precipitation.

Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics holds promise for advancing drug treatment and disease diagnosis; however, its clinical translation has thus far been limited. This is in part due to an unstandardized and segmented sample preparation process that involves cell lysis, protein digestion, peptide desalting, and phosphopeptide enrichment. Automating this entire sample preparation process will be key in facilitating standardization and clinical translation of phosphoproteomics. While peptide desalting and phosphopeptide enrichment steps have been individually automated, integrating these two extractions and, further, the entire process requires more advanced robotic platforms as well as automation-friendly extraction tools.

Significant differences in the relative abundances of the ions observed in positive and negative mode MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) are revealed as the AuNP size distribution is decreased from 10 to 2 nm, whereby 2-nm AuNPs exhibit quantum confinement effects prevalent in quantum dots. AuNP matrixes allow for selective analyte ionization, as demonstrated in the selective MALDI-TOFMS of phosphotyrosine in a background of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine peptides.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 102, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 280, "charStart": 104}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 437, "charStart": 282}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 741, "charStart": 439}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 923, "charStart": 743}], "mesh": ["Gold", "Nanostructures", "Oligopeptides", "Phosphopeptides", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Phosphorylation of c-Src at carboxyl-terminal Tyr-527 suppresses tyrosine kinase activity and transforming potential, presumably by facilitating the intramolecular interaction of the C terminus of Src with its SH2 domain. In addition, it has been shown previously that occupancy of the c-Src SH2 domain with a phosphopeptide stimulates c-Src kinase catalytic activity. We have performed analogous studies with v-Src, the transforming protein from Rous sarcoma virus, which has extensive homology with c-Src. v-Src lacks an autoregulatory phosphorylation site, and its kinase domain is constitutively active. Phosphopeptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding c-Src Tyr-527 and a Tyr-Glu-Glu-Ile motif from the hamster polyoma virus middle T antigen inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed v-Src 2- and 4-fold, respectively. To determine the mechanism of this regulation, the Tyr-527 phosphopeptide was substituted with the photoactive amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine at the adjacent positions (N- and C-terminal) to phosphotyrosine. These peptides photoinactivate the v-Src tyrosine kinase 5-fold in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.

Signal transduction by interleukin-12 (IL-12) requires phosphorylation and activation of STAT4. Direct interaction of the SH2 domain of STAT4 with a phosphotyrosine residue in the IL-12 receptor has been proposed to be required for the subsequent STAT4 phosphorylation. The IL-12 receptor beta2 subunit contains three tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain. To test the hypothesis that one of these tyrosines is involved in binding STAT4, phosphopeptides were synthesized according to the amino acid sequences surrounding each of these tyrosine residues. Only the phosphopeptide containing pTyr800 strongly bound to STAT4 in a cell-free binding assay. When this phosphopeptide was introduced into TALL-104 cells, it blocked IL-12-induced STAT4 phosphorylation by competing with the IL-12 receptor for binding to STAT4. A series of alanine replacements was performed in this phosphopeptide to elucidate which amino acids surrounding the pTyr800 residue are critical for STAT4 binding. To summarize, the site on the IL-12 receptor which binds STAT4 can be described as -T-X-X-G-pY(800)-L-, where the core G-pY(800)-L motif is critical for the binding; the threonine at the pY-4 position has only a minor contribution and X represents amino acids not critical for the binding.

We have examined the phosphorylation of a 50,000-dalton cellular polypeptide associated with the Rous sarcoma virus (FSV) transforming protein pp60-src. It has been shown that pp60src forms a complex with two cellular polypeptides, an 89,000-dalton heat-shock protein (89K) and a 50,000-dalton phosphoprotein (50K). The pp60src-associated protein kinase activity phosphorylates at tyrosine residues, and the 50K polypeptide present in the complex contains phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. These observations suggest that the 50K polypeptide may be a substrate for the protein kinase activity of pp60src. To examine this possibility, we isolated the 50K polypeptide by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from lysates of uninfected or virally infected cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis indicated that the 50K polypeptide isolated by this method was the same polypeptide as that complexed to pp60src. In uninfected cells or cells infected by a transformation-defective mutant, the 50K polypeptide contained phosphoserine but little or no phosphotyrosine. In cells infected by Schmidt-Ruppin or Prague RSV, there was a 40- to 50-fold increase in the quantity of phosphotyrosine in the 50K protein. Thus, the phosphorylation of the 50K polypeptide at tyrosine is dependent on the presence of pp60src. However, the 50K polypeptide isolated from cells infected by temperature-sensitive mutants of RSV was found to be phosphorylated at tyrosine at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures; this behavior is different from that of other substrates or putative substrates of the pp60src kinase activity.

How adaptor or scaffold proteins assemble signaling complexes through both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues to regulate specific signaling pathways and biological responses is unclear. We show in multiple cell types that endogenous 14-3-3zeta is phosphorylated on Tyr(179) in response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Phosphate groups could be removed in vitro by treatment with various phosphatases and could be added in vivo by incubating embryo-derived cells or nuclei in the presence of [32P]-orthophosphate. Phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated ftz protein yielded both phosphoserines and phosphothreonines at a ratio of approximately 1:1. Interestingly we find that the endogenous ftz protein is also phosphorylated at multiple sites and that different subsets of the phosphoisoforms occur during different stages of development.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 88, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 260, "charStart": 90}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 428, "charStart": 262}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 553, "charStart": 430}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 748, "charStart": 555}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 892, "charStart": 750}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1083, "charStart": 894}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Fushi Tarazu Transcription Factors", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Insect Hormones", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a negative regulator of multiple signal transduction pathways. We observed that SHP-1 effectively antagonized Src-dependent phosphorylations in HEK293 cells. This occurred by dephosphorylation of Src substrates, because Src activity was unaffected in the presence of SHP-1. One reason for efficient dephosphorylation was activation of SHP-1 by Src. Recombinant SHP-1 had elevated activity subsequent to phosphorylation by Src in vitro, and SHP-1 variants with mutated phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, SHP-1 Y538F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F were less active toward Src-generated phosphoproteins in intact cells. A second reason for efficient dephosphorylation is the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. Pull-down experiments with different GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins revealed efficient interaction of Src-generated phosphoproteins with the SHP-1 catalytic domain rather than with the SH2 domains. Phosphopeptides that correspond to good Src substrates were efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1 in vitro. Phosphorylated \"optimal Src substrate\" AEEEIpYGEFEA (where pY is phosphotyrosine) and a phosphopeptide corresponding to a recently identified Src phosphorylation site in p120 catenin, DDLDpY(296)GMMSD, were excellent SHP-1 substrates. Docking of these phosphopeptides into the catalytic domain of SHP-1 by molecular modeling was consistent with the biochemical data and explains the efficient interaction. Acidic residues N-terminal of the phosphotyrosine seem to be of major importance for efficient substrate interaction. Residues C-terminal of the phosphotyrosine probably contribute to the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. We propose that activation of SHP-1 by Src and complementary substrate specificities of SHP-1 and Src may lead to very transient Src signals in the presence of SHP-1.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 54, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 159, "charStart": 56}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 254, "charStart": 161}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 370, "charStart": 256}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 445, "charStart": 372}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 711, "charStart": 447}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 798, "charStart": 713}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 991, "charStart": 800}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1099, "charStart": 993}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1334, "charStart": 1101}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1505, "charStart": 1336}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1623, "charStart": 1507}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1725, "charStart": 1625}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1892, "charStart": 1727}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Base Sequence", "DNA Primers", "Enzyme Activation", "Humans", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6", "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases", "Substrate Specificity", "src-Family Kinases"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Modifications of ribosomes have been investigated in human epidermoid carcinoma-2 cells at different stages of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection. Very early in infection, there is an increase in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation even in the absence of serum. The same result is obtained in the presence of actinomycin D. At early infection time, ribosomal proteins S2, S3a and Sa are newly phosphorylated. At early and early-late times, three phosphorylated non-ribosomal proteins (v1, v2 and v3) are differently associated temporally to ribosomes. Analyses of proteins extracted from 40S subunits, 80S ribosomes and polysomes show that v1 and v2 are distributed differently among the different ribosomal populations. S6 phosphopeptides were found to be identical after serum stimulation and after viral infection. In every case phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were identified in S6. Only phosphoserine was found in other phosphorylated proteins. Our results indicate that herpes simplex virus type 1 is able to modify pre-existing ribosomes: (i) by stimulating a pre-existing kinase for S6 phosphorylation even in the absence of serum and of viral genome expression; (ii) by inducing new specific kinase activity(ies); and (iii) by association of new, phosphorylated proteins to ribosomes.

PURPOSE: To determine whether tyrosine 116 of the HSV-1 alpha22 protein is involved in virulence and is a potential phosphorylation site. METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to revert the Y116C mutation in the alpha22 gene of the strain OD4 to wild type (C116Y), and the effect of virulence was tested by using a marker transfer-infection protocol in mice. Immunoblot analysis, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, and phosphotyrosine pulldown-immunoblot protocols were used to assess the OD4 alpha22 isoforms. RESULTS: Reversion of the Y116C mutation resulted in a significant increase in the severity of ocular disease compared with the OD4 virus alone. Reversion of the Y116C and a previously identified mutation (S34A) together did not alter the severity of virulence compared with either mutation alone. Immunoblot analysis revealed a loss or reduction in alpha22 isoforms in the OD4 virus compared with wild type (CJ394 virus). The OD4 virus had numerous alterations in the alpha22 tryptic phosphopeptide pattern, including loss of specific peptides and shifts in the position of several peptides. Phosphotyrosine pulldowns revealed a loss of one or more isoforms and shifts in the apparent size of others. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that Y116 is a determinant of peripheral virulence in mice and that mutations at S34 and Y116 affect virulence independently. The data also show that the S34 and Y116 mutations substantially alter phosphorylation of the alpha22 protein, that Y116 is a potential phosphorylation site, and that the alpha22 protein contains at least two phosphotyrosines.

To address these shortcomings, we revisited the merits of performing phosphopeptide enrichment in an HPLC column format. We found that Fe-IMAC columns enabled the selective, comprehensive, and reproducible enrichment of phosphopeptides out of complex lysates. Column enrichment did not suffer from bead-to-sample ratio issues and scaled linearly from 100 \u03bcg to 5 mg of digest.

Combined with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture metabolic labeling, these techniques have made it possible to quantitatively evaluate phosphorylation changes in various physiological states in stable cell lines.

The validity of using elemental phosphorus standards to accurately and precisely quantify phosphopeptides by capillary HPLC (capHPLC) coupled to ICP-collison cell-MS is investigated in detail. Operating requirements to maintain stable (31)P sensitivity along the reversed-phase gradient are described. Specifically, the use of an optimum postcolumn makeup flow with a defined acetonitrile content turned out to be necessary to buffer the acetonitrile variation of the capillary chromatographic eluent and ensure plasma stability. Then, a highly pure P-containing standard (bis(4-nitro-phenyl) phosphate, BNPP) was spiked into the samples and used to quantify them with very low absolute errors (2-4%) and excellent precision (3-6%). The capHPLC-ICPMS method showed excellent linearity over 3 orders of magnitude and provided adequate detection limits (110 fmol, 3.4 pg P). Accurate quantification of the phosphopeptides present in a tryptic digest of beta-casein and casein from bovine milk was then attempted. Previously, and in order to be able to close mass balances, total P contents, percentages of inorganic P present, and recoveries from the reversed-phase column used in the separation were computed for each sample. Quantification using the spiked BNPP for the different phosphopeptides detected matched the expected values well validating the quantitative methodology proposed. The capHPLC-ESIMS analysis allowed elucidating amino acid sequences, a requisite still necessary to translate the determined amount of P in each chromatographic peak into amount of phosphopeptide.

The ESI-MS signal intensity ratios of the four phosphopeptide standards labeled with N-acetoxy-H3-succinimide (H3-NAS) and N-acetoxy-D3-succinimide (D3-NAS), following TiO2/MHMSM capture are linearly correlated with the molar ratios of the \"light\" to \"heavy\" phosphopeptides over the range of 0.1-4 with an r(2) of up to 0.998 and a slope of close to 1. The recovery of the four phosphopeptides spiked at low, medium and high levels in human sera were 98.4-111.9% with RSDs ranging 2.0-10.1%. The absolute quantification of the phosphopeptides in serum samples of 20 healthy persons and 20 gastric cancer patients by the developed method demonstrated that 3 out of the 4 phosphopeptides showed remarkable variation in serum level between healthy and cancer groups, and the phosphopeptide DpSGEGDFLAEGGGVR is significantly down-regulated in the serum of patients, being a potential biomarker for gastric cancer diagnosis.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 112, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 295, "charStart": 114}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 553, "charStart": 297}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 784, "charStart": 555}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 926, "charStart": 786}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1280, "charStart": 928}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1419, "charStart": 1282}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1847, "charStart": 1421}], "mesh": ["Biomarkers, Tumor", "Down-Regulation", "Humans", "Microspheres", "Neoplasms", "Peptides", "Phosphopeptides", "ROC Curve", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Stomach Neoplasms", "Titanium"], "type": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

One of these, a magnesium-dependent species of 18.6 kDa, was purified to homogeneity and yielded several peptide sequences from which the parent gene was identified by database searching. Although orthologous genes were identified in fungi and plants as well as mammalian species, there was no apparent homology to any known family of phosphatases.

Phosphorylation of prolactin by endogenous protein kinases within isolated secretory granules was shown to result in the production of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. The majority of the radiolabel was determined to be present in the C terminus of the molecule after specific cleavage with glandular kallikrein. Glandular kallikrein cleaves in three places at the C terminus, liberating three small peptides, only one of which contains a phosphorylatable residue. Sequencing of this phosphopeptide showed it to be Arg175-Lys185. Thus the major site of prolactin phosphorylation was determined to be serine 177. Using a synthetic peptide equivalent to this region of the molecule (Ser161-Val180), serine 177 was demonstrated to be a substrate for protein kinase A as well as for one of the endogenous granule kinases. Inclusion of the synthetic peptide in an endogenous granule phosphorylation reaction resulted in competition for the kinase and reduced phosphorylation of prolactin. Protein kinase A phosphorylation of purified prolactin resulted in the production of only phosphoserine and primarily the most abundant (monophosphorylated) variant. We conclude that serine 177 is the major in vivo phosphorylation site of rat prolactin and that phosphorylation of this site can be reproduced by protein kinase A in vitro.

However, extracting confident phosphopeptide identifications from the resulting large data sets in a similar high-throughput fashion remains difficult, as does rigorously estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of a set of phosphopeptide identifications. This article describes a data analysis pipeline designed to address these issues. The first step is to reanalyze phosphopeptide identifications that contain ambiguous assignments for the incorporated phosphate(s) to determine the most likely arrangement of the phosphate(s). The next step is to employ an expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of the peptide scores. A linear discriminant analysis is then performed to determine how to optimally combine peptide scores (in this case, from SEQUEST) into a discriminant score that possesses the maximum discriminating power. Based on this discriminant score, the p- and q-values for each phosphopeptide identification are calculated, and the phosphopeptide identification FDR is then estimated.

The initial indication of protein modification came from Western immunoblot analysis of the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) profile of M. pneumoniae proteins, revealing multiple spots for both HMW1 and HMW4 that varied in pI but not in size.

While affinity reagents are valuable tools for monitoring protein phosphorylation and studying signaling events in cells, generating them through immunization of animals with phosphopeptides is expensive, laborious, and time-consuming. An attractive alternative is to use protein evolution techniques and isolate new anti-phosphopeptide binding specificities from a library of variants of a phosphopeptide-binding domain. To explore this strategy, we attempted to display on the surface of bacteriophage M13 the N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA1) domain of yeast Rad53p, which is a naturally occurring phosphothreonine (pT)-binding domain, and found it to be nonfunctional due to misfolding in the bacterial periplasm. To overcome this limitation, we constructed a library of FHA1 variants by mutagenic PCR and isolated functional variants after three rounds of affinity selection with its pT peptide ligand. A hydrophobic residue at position 34 in the \u03b21 strand was discovered to be essential for phage display of a functional FHA1 domain. Additionally, by heating the phage library to 50\u00b0C prior to affinity selection with its cognate pT peptide, we identified a variant (G2) that was ~8\u00b0C more thermally stable than the wild-type domain.

Cellular organization and response to internal and external stimuli are mediated by an intricate web of protein interactions. Some of these interactions are regulated by covalent posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. These modifications can change the chemical nature of the interaction interfaces and modulate the binding affinity of the interacting partners. In signal transduction, the most frequent modification is reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine or threonine residues. Protein phosphorylation may modulate the activity of enzymes by modifying their conformation, or regulate the formation of complexes by creating docking sites to recruit downstream effectors. Families of modular domains, such as SH2, PTB, and 14-3-3, act as \"readers\" of the modification event. Specificity between closely related domains of the same family is mediated by the chemical properties of the domain binding surface that, aside from offering a hydrophilic pocket for the phosphorylated residue, shows preference for specific sequences. Although the protein structure and the cell context are also important to ensure specificity, the amino acid sequence flanking the phosphorylation site defines the accuracy of the recognition process, and it is therefore essential to define the binding specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains in order to understand and to infer the interaction web mediated by phosphopeptides. Methods commonly used to discover new interactions (such as yeast two hybrid and phage display) are not suited to study interactions with phosphorylated proteins.

{"text": "Tailor-Made Detection of Individual Phosphorylated and Non-Phosphorylated EPIYA-Motifs of Helicobacter pylori Oncoprotein CagA. The gastric pathogen and carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) encodes a type IV secretion system for translocation of the effector protein CagA into host cells. Injected CagA becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at the five amino acid residue Glutamate-Proline- Isoleucine-Tyrosine-Alanine (EPIYA)-sequence motifs. These phosphorylated EPIYA-sites represent recognition motifs for binding of multiple host factors, which then manipulate signaling pathways to trigger gastric disease. Thus, efficient detection of single phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs in CagA is required. Detection of phospho-CagA is primarily performed using commercial pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies. However, those antibodies were originally generated to recognize many phosphotyrosines in various mammalian proteins and are not optimized for use in bacteria. To address this important limitation, we synthesized 11-mer phospho- and non-phospho-peptides from EPIYA-motifs A, B, and C, and produced three phospho-specific and three non-phospho-specific rabbit polyclonal CagA antibodies. These antibodies specifically recognized the corresponding phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs, while the EPIYA-C antibodies also recognized the related East-Asian EPIYA-D motif. Otherwise, no cross-reactivity of the antibodies among EPIYAs was observed. Western blotting demonstrated that each EPIYA-motif can be predominantly phosphorylated during H. pylori infection. This represents the first complete set of phospho-specific antibodies for an effector protein in bacteria, providing useful tools to gather information for the categorization of CagA phosphorylation, cancer signaling, and gastric disease progression.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126}, "docId": "31412675", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 293, "charStart": 128}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 442, "charStart": 295}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 611, "charStart": 444}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 696, "charStart": 613}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 794, "charStart": 698}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 954, "charStart": 796}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1181, "charStart": 956}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1375, "charStart": 1183}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1451, "charStart": 1377}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1567, "charStart": 1453}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1818, "charStart": 1569}]}
{"docId": "8535240", "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 133}, "text": "Posttranslational modifications of bovine osteopontin: identification of twenty-eight phosphorylation and three O-glycosylation sites. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multiphosphorylated glycoprotein found in bone and other normal and malignant tissues, as well as in the physiological fluids urine and milk. The present study demonstrates that bovine milk osteopontin is phosphorylated at 27 serine residues and 1 threonine residue. Phosphoamino acids were identified by a combination of amino acid analysis, sequence analysis of S-ethylcysteine-derivatized phosphopeptides, and mass spectrometric analysis. Twenty-five phosphoserines and one phosphothreonine were located in Ser/Thr-X-Glu/Ser(P)/Asp motifs, and two phosphoserines were found in the sequence Ser-X-X-Glu/Ser(P). These sequence motifs are identical with the recognition sequences of mammary gland casein kinase and casein kinase II, respectively. Examination of the phosphorylation pattern revealed that the phosphorylations were clustered in groups of approximately three spanned by unphosphorylated regions of 11-32 amino acids. This pattern is probably of importance in the multiple functions of OPN involving interaction with Ca2+ and inorganic calcium salts. Furthermore, three O-glycosylated threonines (Thr 115, Thr 124, and Thr 129) have been identified in a threonine- and proline-rich region of the protein. Three putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn 63, Asn 85, and Asn 193) are present in bovine osteopontin, but sequence and mass spectrometric analysis showed that none of these asparagines were glycosylated in bovine mammary gland osteopontin. Alignment analysis showed that the majority of the phosphorylation sites in bovine osteopontin as well as all three O-glycosylation sites were conserved in other mammalian sequences. This conservation of serines, even in otherwise less well-conserved regions of the protein, indicates that the phosphorylation of osteopontin at specific sites is essential for the function of the protein.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 133, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 298, "charStart": 135}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 423, "charStart": 300}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 598, "charStart": 425}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 769, "charStart": 600}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 903, "charStart": 771}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1087, "charStart": 905}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1220, "charStart": 1089}, {"index"
