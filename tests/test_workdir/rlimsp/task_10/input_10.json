Activation of cyclic nucleotide dependent signaling pathways leads to relaxation of smooth muscle, alterations in the cytoskeleton of cultured cells, and increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20. To determine the effects of phosphorylated HSP20 on the actin cytoskeleton, phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 were synthesized. These peptides contained 1) the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site of HSP20, 2) a phosphoserine, and 3) a protein transduction domain. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 led to loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, interference reflection microscopy, and biochemical quantitation of globular-actin. Treatment with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 also led to dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin. Pull-down assays demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins associated with phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 (but not peptide analogs in which the serine was not phosphorylated). The binding of 14-3-3 protein to phosphopeptide analogs of HSP20 prevented the association of cofilin with 14-3-3. These data suggest that HSP20 may modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics by competing with the actin depolymerizing protein cofilin for binding to the scaffolding protein 14-3-3. Interestingly, the entire protein was not needed for this effect, suggesting that the association is modulated by phosphopeptide motifs of HSP20. These data also suggest the possibility that cyclic nucleotide dependent relaxation of smooth muscle may be mediated by a thin filament (actin) regulatory process. Finally, these data suggest that protein transduction can be used as a tool to elucidate the specific function of peptide motifs of proteins.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 86, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 283, "charStart": 88}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 409, "charStart": 285}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 566, "charStart": 411}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 820, "charStart": 568}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 942, "charStart": 822}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1111, "charStart": 944}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1226, "charStart": 1113}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1403, "charStart": 1228}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1549, "charStart": 1405}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1713, "charStart": 1551}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1855, "charStart": 1715}], "mesh": ["14-3-3 Proteins", "3T3 Cells", "Actin Depolymerizing Factors", "Actinin", "Actins", "Animals", "Binding Sites", "Cell Line", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Cytoskeleton", "Focal Adhesions", "HSP20 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "Mice", "Microfilament Proteins", "Paxillin", "Peptides", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Vinculin"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

In an attempt to understand how Hck and Src can function both independently and in concert, we have compared 1) their in vitro substrate specificity and 2) the accessibility of their Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Using several synthetic peptides, we have demonstrated that Hck and Src recognize similar structural features in the substrate peptides, suggesting that both kinases have the intrinsic ability to carry out overlapping cellular functions by phosphorylating similar cellular proteins in vivo. Using a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide that has previously been shown to bind the SH2 domain of Src family kinases with high affinity, we found that although Src could bind to the phosphopeptide, Hck showed no interaction. The inability of Hck to bind the phosphopeptide was not a result of a stable intramolecular interaction between its SH2 domain and C-terminal regulatory phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr-520), as most Hck molecules in the purified Hck preparation were not tyrosine-phosphorylated. In contrast to intact Hck, a recombinant truncation analog of Hck was able to bind the phosphopeptide with an affinity similar to that of the Src SH2 domain, suggesting that conformational constraints are imposed on intact Hck that limit accessibility of its SH2 domain to the phosphopeptide. Furthermore, the difference in SH2 domain accessibility is a potential mechanism that enables Src and Hck to perform their respective unique functions by 1) targeting them to different subcellular compartments, whereupon they phosphorylate different cellular proteins, and/or 2) facilitating direct binding to their cellular substrates.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 176, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 391, "charStart": 178}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 603, "charStart": 393}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 894, "charStart": 605}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1121, "charStart": 896}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1397, "charStart": 1123}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1690, "charStart": 1399}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 2027, "charStart": 1692}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Chromatography, Ion Exchange", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphorylation", "Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)", "Recombinant Proteins", "Subcellular Fractions", "Substrate Specificity", "Tyrosine", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Two site-specific antibodies have been prepared by immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides derived from the partial cDNA-predicted amino acid sequence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), which has been proposed to encode the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) kinase (Boulton, T. G., Yancopoulos, G. D., Gregory, J. S., Slauer, C., Moomaw, C., Hsu, J., and Cobb, M. H. (1990) Science 249, 64-67). With immunoprecipitation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Western blotting, an antibody to the peptide containing triple tyrosine residues (alpha Y91) resembling one of the insulin receptor autophosphorylation sites specifically recognized 42- and 44-kDa proteins. On the other hand, an antibody to the peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus portions (alpha C92) of the ERK1 cDNA gene product recognized the 44-kDa protein much more efficiently than the 42-kDa protein. With immunoprecipitation in the absence of SDS, alpha Y91 could barely recognize these two proteins and alpha C92 recognized the 44-kDa protein but failed to recognize the 42-kDa protein. Kinase assays in myelin basic protein (MBP)-containing gel, after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that insulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha Y91 immunoprecipitates comigrated at molecular mass 42 and 44 kDa. On the other hand, the stimulated MBP kinase activity in alpha C92 immunoprecipitates comigrated only at molecular mass 44 kDa. Insulin stimulated the MBP kinase activity in gels and phosphorylation of these two proteins by greater than 10-fold with a maximal level at 5 min. Insulin and TPA rapidly stimulate the phosphorylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins via de novo threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.

The analysis of phosphopeptide anions is warranted due to their relatively acidic character. As femtosecond laser-induced ionization/dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (fsLID-MS/MS) is uniquely initiated by field ionization, an investigation is warranted to determine whether fsLID may provide novel analytical utility for phosphopeptide anions. METHODS: Twenty-three synthetic deprotonated phosphopeptide anions were introduced into a three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization. The ion trap was interfaced with a near-IR (802\u2009nm) ultrashort-pulsed (35\u2009fs FWHM) ultrahigh-powered (peak power ~10(14) \u2009W/cm(2)) laser system. Performance comparisons are made with other techniques applied to phosphopeptide anion analysis, including CID, electron detachment dissociation (EDD), negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD), activated electron photodetachment dissociation (activated-EPD), and ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD). RESULTS: FsLID-MS/MS of multiply deprotonated phosphopeptide anions provides sequence information via phosphorylation-intact a/x ions in addition to other sequence ions, satellite ions, and side-chain losses. Novel fragmentation processes include selective c-ion formation N-terminal to Ser/Thr and a phosphorylation-specific correlation between xn -98 ion abundances and phosphorylation at the n(th) residue. Sequencing-quality data required about 30\u2009s of signal averaging. fsLID-MS/MS of singly deprotonated phosphopeptides did not yield product anions with stable trajectories, despite significant depletion of the precursor. CONCLUSIONS: Multiply deprotonated phosphopeptide anions were sequenced via negative-mode fsLID-MS/MS, with phosphosite localization facilitated by a/x ion series in addition to diagnostic x(n)-98 ions. fsLID-MS/MS is qualitatively competitive with other techniques. Further efficiency enhancements (e.g., implementation on a linear trap or/and higher pulse frequencies) may permit sequence analyses on chromatographic timescales.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 296, "charStart": 128}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 389, "charStart": 298}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 645, "charStart": 391}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 820, "charStart": 647}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 965, "charStart": 822}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1272, "charStart": 967}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1481, "charStart": 1274}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1682, "charStart": 1483}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1747, "charStart": 1684}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1901, "charStart": 1749}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2104, "charStart": 1903}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2168, "charStart": 2106}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2332, "charStart": 2170}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Anions", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phosphopeptides", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

In this study we describe the phosphorylation of annexins from cultured rat mesangial cells by protein kinase C (PKC) both in vitro and in vivo. Annexins I and II were detected either by Western-blot analysis or by immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. In the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, cytosolic annexin I and annexin II were phosphorylated in vitro only when Ca2+ and phospholipids were added, but not in the presence of phospholipids alone. Annexin I was shown to be a better substrate than annexin II. In experiments in vivo performed on 32P-labelled mesangial cells, the addition of two well-known activators of PKC, namely angiotensin II (AII) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), increased preferentially the phosphorylation of annexin I. Annexin II was phosphorylated to a much lesser extent after AII treatment. Phosphoamino acid analysis of annexins, either by two-dimensional chromatography or by using a specific antiphosphotyrosine antibody, revealed only phosphoserine in these experiments in vivo. The addition of AII to mesangial cells increased serine phosphorylation of annexin I and annexin II, whereas PMA only increased serine phosphorylation of annexin I. V8-protease phosphopeptide mapping of annexin I that was phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by PKC from mesangial cells shows similar phosphopeptides.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 82, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 227, "charStart": 84}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 344, "charStart": 229}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 536, "charStart": 346}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 598, "charStart": 538}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 913, "charStart": 600}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1105, "charStart": 915}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1427, "charStart": 1107}], "mesh": ["Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Annexin A1", "Annexin A2", "Calcium", "Cells, Cultured", "Glomerular Mesangium", "Phospholipids", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase C", "Rats", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

Nck is a small adaptor protein consisting exclusively of three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain. Nck is thought to have an important role in cell signalling by coupling receptor tyrosine kinases, via its SH2 domain, to downstream SH3-binding effectors. We report here that angiotensin II, working through the AT1 receptor subtype, stimulates the phosphorylation of Nck in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis revealed that Nck is phosphorylated on four peptides containing exclusively phosphoserine in quiescent cells. Treatment with angiotensin II resulted in increased phosphorylation of these four peptides, without the appearance of new phosphopeptides. We show that Nck, via its SH3 domains, specifically binds three major phosphoproteins of 95, 82 and 66 kDa both in vitro and in intact cells. Notably, the phosphorylation of these Nck-binding proteins was found to increase in parallel with that of Nck on stimulation by angiotensin II. One candidate for the 66 kDa phosphoprotein is the serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), which was found to form a stable complex with Nck in aortic smooth muscle cells. We have also identified the gamma2 isoform of casein kinase I as another protein kinase that associates with Nck in these cells. These findings indicate that Nck is a target of G-protein-coupled receptors and suggest a role for Pak1 and casein kinase I-gamma2 in downstream signalling or regulation of the AT1 receptor.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 251, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 407, "charStart": 253}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 558, "charStart": 409}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 700, "charStart": 560}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 839, "charStart": 702}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 981, "charStart": 841}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1125, "charStart": 983}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1312, "charStart": 1127}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1441, "charStart": 1314}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1632, "charStart": 1443}], "mesh": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Casein Kinases", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Oncogene Proteins", "Peptide Mapping", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Protein Binding", "Protein Kinases", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Rats", "Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1", "Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2", "Receptors, Angiotensin", "Signal Transduction", "p21-Activated Kinases", "src Homology Domains"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Several tumor lines of neuronal origin were assayed for the presence of two forms of pp60c-src, designated pp60 and pp60+. To determine the specific kinase activity of pp60 and pp60+, an enzymatic analysis was carried out with neuroblastoma LA-N-5, containing a high level of pp60+, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, containing a low level of pp60+, fibroblast FSD, containing pp60 but no pp60+, and Rous sarcoma virus transformed 3T3 cells, SR-3T3, containing pp60v-src. Km values for Mg2+-ATP of approximately 21, 8, 17 and 13 microM were determined for pp60src kinase from LA-N-5, SK-N-SH, FSD and SR-3T3 respectively, using enolase as a substrate. The Vmax values for pp60c-src kinase from LA-N-5, SK-N-SH and FSD were similar. The Vmax value of pp60v-src was about 50-fold higher. Thirteen distinct phosphopeptides were found in tryptic digests from pp60 and pp60+ labeled in vivo with [32P].

Only phosphoserine was detected in the N-terminus of pp60 and pp60+.
