Disodium phenyl phosphate was primarily selected as the model sample. The results indicated that phosphate group was difficultly to be ionized when the pH value of mobile phase was below its pKa value. The retention of disodium phenyl phosphate on the Click OEG-CD matrix was not based on ion exchange interaction, leading to the weak retention. The influence of pH value (2, 4 and 6) of mobile phase under hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode on phosphopeptide enrichment selectivity was investigated taking the digest of alpha-casein as a sample.

In this work, we fabricated a yolk-shell magnetic composite that contains mesoporous TiO2 as the inner shell and flowerlike NiO as the outer shell (denoted as Fe3O4@H-TiO2@f-NiO) to reduce the limitations of single-component metal oxides in phosphopeptide enrichment. The NiO nanosheets play a synergistic role in phosphopeptide enrichment. And the unique flowerlike structure of NiO with sufficient space can facilitate the reversible insertion/extraction of peptides, which will have less impact on the enrichment process of the inner TiO2 shell. The yolk-shell structure and two types of porous nanostructures endowed this composite with a high surface area (156.58 m2 g-1) and a large pore volume (0.37 cm3 g-1). Owing to the high surface area and combined properties of TiO2 and NiO, the Fe3O4@H-TiO2@f-NiO microspheres showed a better performance for phosphopeptide enrichment than the same material without NiO nanosheets (Fe3O4@H-TiO2). According to the LC-MS/MS results, 972 unique phosphopeptides were identified from HeLa cell extracts with a high selectivity (91.9%) by Fe3O4@H-TiO2@f-NiO relative to 837 phosphopeptides (selectivity: 60.2%) by Fe3O4@H-TiO2.

Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are mostly found in multicellular organisms where they recognize phosphotyrosine-containing signaling proteins. Spt6, a conserved transcription factor and putative histone chaperone, contains a C-terminal SH2 domain conserved from yeast to human. In mammals, this SH2 domain recognizes phosphoserines rather than phosphotyrosines and is essential for the recruitment of Spt6 by elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), enabling Spt6 to participate in the coupling of transcription elongation, chromatin modulation, and mRNA export. We have determined the structure of the entire Spt6 C-terminal region from Antonospora locustae, revealing the presence of two highly conserved tandem SH2 domains rather than a single SH2 domain. Although the first SH2 domain has a canonical organization, the second SH2 domain is highly noncanonical and appears to be unique in the SH2 family. However, both SH2 domains have phosphate-binding determinants. Our biochemical and genetic data demonstrate that the complete tandem, but not the individual SH2 domains, are necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Spt6 with RNAPII and are important for Spt6 function in vivo. Furthermore, our data suggest that binding of RNAPII to the Spt6 tandem SH2 is more extensive than the mere recognition of a doubly phosphorylated C-terminal domain peptide by the tandem SH2.

However, the impact of phosphorylation on the antigenic identity of phosphopeptide epitopes is unclear. Here we examined this by determining structures of MHC-bound phosphopeptides bearing canonical position 4-phosphorylations in the presence and absence of their phosphate moiety, and examining phosphopeptide recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR). Strikingly, two peptides exhibited major conformational changes upon phosphorylation, involving a similar molecular mechanism, which focussed changes on the central peptide region most critical for T cell recognition. In contrast, a third epitope displayed little conformational alteration upon phosphorylation. In addition, binding studies demonstrated TCR interaction with an MHC-bound phosphopeptide was both epitope-specific and absolutely dependent upon phosphorylation status.

Online enrichment of phosphopeptides attracts particular interests due to its automated operation, higher throughput and reproducibility, lower sample loss, and contamination. Here, we report a new type of capillary column developed using surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) for automated online phosphopeptide enrichment. SI-ATRP modification leads to a surface confined growth of three-dimensional wavelike polymer structure on the inner wall of capillary columns and, therefore, results in largely increased surface area. Furthermore, the noncross-linked flexible polymer chains grown by SI-ATRP create a large internal volume that allows phosphopeptides to penetrate into during enrichment and also facilitate the interaction between the numerous functional groups in the polymer chains and target phosphopeptides. Therefore, highly efficient and specific enrichment is achieved even for a low femtomole of phosphopeptides. The loading capacity is increased more than an order of magnitude compared with that obtained using conventional open tubular capillary columns. The SI-ATRP modified capillary column was successful applied in the online phosphoproteomics analysis of HepG2 cell lysate and resulted in 10 times improved phosphopeptide identification than the previously reported number.

The binding of tyrosine phosphorylated targets by SH2 domains is required for propagation of many cellular signals in higher eukaryotes; however, the determinants of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition by SH2 domains are not well understood. In order to identify the attributes of pTyr required for high affinity interaction with SH2 domains, the binding of the SH2 domain of the Src kinase (Src SH2 domain) to a dephosphorylated peptide, a phosphoserine-containing peptide, and the amino acid pTyr was studied using titration calorimetry and compared with the binding of a high affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide. The dephosphorylated peptide and the phosphoserine containing peptide both bind extremely weakly to the Src SH2 domain (DeltaGo (dephosphorylated)=-3.6 kcal/mol, DeltaGo (phosphoserine) >-3.7 kcal/mol); however, the DeltaGo value of pTyr binding is more favorable (-4.7 kcal/mol, or 50 % of the entire binding free energy of a high affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide). These results indicate that both the phosphate and the tyrosine ring of the pTyr are critical determinants of high affinity binding. Alanine mutagenesis was also used to evaluate the energetic contribution to binding of ten residues located in the pTyr-binding site. Mutation of the strictly conserved Arg betaB5 resulted in a large increase in DeltaGo (DeltaDeltaGo=3.2 kcal/mol) while elimination of the other examined residues each resulted in a significantly smaller (DeltaDeltaGo<1.4 kcal/mol) reduction in affinity, indicating that Arg betaB5 is the single most important determinant of pTyr recognition. However, mutation of Cys betaC3, a residue unique to the Src SH2 domain, surprisingly increased affinity by eightfold (DeltaDeltaGo=-1.1 kcal/mol). Using a double mutant cycle analysis, it was revealed that residues of the pTyr-binding pocket are not coupled to the peptide residues C-terminal to the pTyr. In addition, comparison of each residue's DeltaDeltaGo value upon mutation with that residue's sequence conservation among SH2 domains revealed only a modest correlation between a residue's energetic contribution to pTyr recognition and its conservation throughout evolution.

Compared to other state-of the-art technologies, like use of TiO(2) and Fe-IMAC, the presented technique demonstrated a superior performance with respect to specificity and bias with respect to singly or multiply phosphorylated peptides. Additionally, this platform was also successfully applied for ESI sample preparation, providing detailed sequence information of the investigated phosphopeptide. This technology was also proven to be applicable for real life samples such as phosphorylation site analysis of recombinant human MAPK1 and HSP B1 isolated from a 2D-gel spot by phosphopeptide enrichment and direct MALDI MS/MS.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 125, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 302, "charStart": 127}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 469, "charStart": 304}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 601, "charStart": 471}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1095, "charStart": 603}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1198, "charStart": 1097}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1436, "charStart": 1200}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1598, "charStart": 1438}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1826, "charStart": 1600}], "mesh": ["Caseins", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1", "Organophosphonates", "Phosphopeptides", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Surface Properties", "Zirconium"], "type": ["Journal Article"]}

Increasing number of studies report the relevance of protein Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in bacterial physiology, yet the analysis of this type of modification in bacteria still presents a considerable challenge. Unlike in eukaryotes, where tens of thousands of phosphorylation events likely occupy more than two thirds of the proteome, the abundance of protein phosphorylation is much lower in bacteria. Even the state-of-the-art phosphopeptide enrichment protocols fail to remove the high background of abundant unmodified peptides, leading to low signal intensity and undersampling of phosphopeptide precursor ions in consecutive data-dependent MS runs. Consequently, large-scale bacterial phosphoproteomic datasets often suffer from poor reproducibility and a high number of missing values. Here we explore the application of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer in bacterial phosphoproteome analysis, focusing especially on run-to-run sampling reproducibility. In multiple measurements of identical phosphopeptide-enriched samples, we show that PRM outperforms data-dependent acquisition (DDA) in terms of detection frequency, reaching almost complete sampling efficiency, compared to 20% in DDA. We observe a similar trend over multiple heterogeneous phosphopeptide-enriched samples and conclude that PRM shows a great promise in bacterial phosphoproteomics analyses where reproducible detection and quantification of a relatively small set of phosphopeptides is desired. SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial phosphorylated peptides occur in low abundance compared to their unmodified counterparts, and are therefore rarely reproducibly detected in shotgun (DDA) proteomics measurements. Here we show that parallel reaction monitoring complements DDA analyses and makes detection of known, targeted phosphopeptides more reproducible. This will be of significance in replicated MS measurements that have a goal to reproducibly detect and quantify phosphopeptides of interest.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 160, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 373, "charStart": 162}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 565, "charStart": 375}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 817, "charStart": 567}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 955, "charStart": 819}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1158, "charStart": 957}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1394, "charStart": 1160}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1670, "charStart": 1396}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1873, "charStart": 1672}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 2019, "charStart": 1875}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 2160, "charStart": 2021}], "mesh": ["Bacterial Proteins", "Escherichia coli", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Reproducibility of Results"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

INTRODUCTIONWhether using a pressure cell or gel-loader tips, IMAC-purified peptides can be injected into a \u03bcLC separation system and analyzed by \u03bcLC-ESI-MS/MS. Phosphopeptides behave and elute similarly to nonphosphorylated peptides during RP-HPLC, but because of a decrease in hydrophobicity due to the addition of the phosphate moiety, a phosphopeptide will generally elute before the nonphosphopeptide with the identical amino acid sequence. This difference in elution time is most pronounced for short peptides. Thus, when analyzing phosphopeptides from \u03bcLC online with ESI-MS/MS, it is prudent to acquire data during the wash step (i.e., prior to gradient elution), as some short phosphopeptides may not even bind to the C(18) resin in 100% aqueous solutions.

Global phosphorylation changes in plants in response to environmental stress have been relatively poorly characterized to date. Here we introduce a novel mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitation method that facilitates systematic profiling plant phosphoproteome changes with high efficiency and accuracy. This method employs synthetic peptide libraries tailored specifically as internal standards for complex phosphopeptide samples and accordingly, a local normalization algorithm, LAXIC, which calculates phosphopeptide abundance normalized locally with co-eluting library peptides. Normalization was achieved in a small time frame centered to each phosphopeptide to compensate for the diverse ion suppression effect across retention time. The label-free LAXIC method was further treated with a linear regression function to accurately measure phosphoproteome responses to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis.

Despite intense, continued interest in global analyses of signaling cascades through mass spectrometry-based studies, the large-scale, systematic production of phosphoproteomics data has been hampered in-part by inefficient fractionation strategies subsequent to phosphopeptide enrichment. Here we explore two novel multidimensional fractionation strategies for analysis of phosphopeptides. In the first technique we utilize aliphatic ion pairing agents to improve retention of phosphopeptides at high pH in the first dimension of a two-dimensional RP-RP. The second approach is based on the addition of strong anion exchange as the second dimension in a three-dimensional reversed phase (RP)-strong anion exchange (SAX)-RP configuration. Both techniques provide for automated, online data acquisition, with the 3-D platform providing the highest performance both in terms of separation peak capacity and the number of unique phosphopeptide sequences identified per \u03bcg of cell lysate consumed. Our integrated RP-SAX-RP platform provides several analytical figures of merit, including: (1) orthogonal separation mechanisms in each dimension; (2) high separation peak capacity (3) efficient retention of singly- and multiply-phosphorylated peptides; (4) compatibility with automated, online LC-MS analysis.

Proteomics studies reveal changes in the secretory pathway. BACKGROUND: The secretion of heterologous animal proteins in filamentous fungi is usually limited by bottlenecks in the vesicle-mediated secretory pathway. RESULTS: Using the secretion of bovine chymosin in Aspergillus awamori as a model, we found a drastic increase (40 to 80-fold) in cells grown with casein or casein phosphopeptides (CPPs). CPPs are rich in phosphoserine, but phosphoserine itself did not increase the secretion of chymosin. The stimulatory effect is reduced about 50% using partially dephosphorylated casein and is not exerted by casamino acids. The phosphopeptides effect was not exerted at transcriptional level, but instead, it was clearly observed on the secretion of chymosin by immunodetection analysis. Proteomics studies revealed very interesting metabolic changes in response to phosphopeptides supplementation. The oxidative metabolism was reduced, since enzymes involved in fermentative processes were overrepresented. An oxygen-binding hemoglobin-like protein was overrepresented in the proteome following phosphopeptides addition. Most interestingly, the intracellular pre-protein enzymes, including pre-prochymosin, were depleted (most of them are underrepresented in the intracellular proteome after the addition of CPPs), whereas the extracellular mature form of several of these secretable proteins and cell-wall biosynthetic enzymes was greatly overrepresented in the secretome of phosphopeptides-supplemented cells. Another important 'moonlighting' protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which has been described to have vesicle fusogenic and cytoskeleton formation modulating activities, was clearly overrepresented in phosphopeptides-supplemented cells.

The rats in control group received sham burn trauma, and burn and burn + anisomycin groups received 30% total body surface area (TBSA) full thickness burn injury. Anisomycin (5 mg/kg) together with 250 microl dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was injected to the rats in anisomycin group intravenously, and only 250 microl DMSO in the other two groups.

Recent advances in phosphopeptide enrichment prior to mass spectrometric analysis show genuine promise for characterization of phosphoproteomes. Tandem mass spectrometry of phosphopeptide ions, using collision-activated dissociation (CAD), often produces product ions dominated by the neutral loss of phosphoric acid. Here we describe a novel method, termed Pseudo MS(n), for phosphopeptide ion dissociation in quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers. The method induces collisional activation of product ions, those resulting from neutral loss(es) of phosphoric acid, following activation of the precursor ion. Thus, the principal neutral loss product ions are converted into a variety of structurally informative species. Since product ions from both the original precursor activation and all subsequent neutral loss product activations are simultaneously stored, the method generates a \"composite\" spectrum containing fragments derived from multiple precursors. In comparison to analysis by conventional MS/MS (CAD), Pseudo MS(n) shows improved phosphopeptide ion dissociation for 7 out of 10 synthetic phosphopeptides, as judged by an automated search algorithm (TurboSEQUEST). A similar overall improvement was observed upon application of Pseudo MS(n) to peptides generated by enzymatic digestion of a single phosphoprotein. Finally, when applied to a complex phosphopeptide mixture, several phosphopeptides mis-assigned by TurboSEQUEST under the conventional CAD approach were successfully identified after analysis by Pseudo MS(n).", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 119, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 264, "charStart": 121}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 437, "charStart": 266}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 570, "charStart": 439}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 730, "charStart": 572}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 842, "charStart": 732}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1083, "charStart": 844}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1300, "charStart": 1085}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1449, "charStart": 1302}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1658, "charStart": 1451}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Mass Spectrometry", "Phosphopeptides", "Protons", "Sequence Analysis, Protein"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

Recently, growth factors are known to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of proteins to regulate cellular functions. We investigated growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of membrane proteins in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The phosphorylation experiments were done in membrane preparations of cultured RPE cell and the reaction was started by applying [32P]adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) at 0 degrees C, and terminated after 0, 1, 5, 15, and 30 min. The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were analyzed by autoradiography. Many proteins showed time-dependent phosphorylation. Among them, a 170 kDa protein showed platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-specific phosphorylation with both time- (up to 30 min) and dose-(maximal effect at 50 ng/ml) dependence. On the other hand, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) showed no specific phosphorylation.

To study the cytoskeletal association of these tyrosine kinases, Triton X-100-resistant fractions were prepared from GCPs. All three non-receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with the cytoskeleton to a significant degree with the relative affinities: fyn > c-src > lyn. The binding is sensitive to ionic strength and to phosphotyrosine, but not to phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. To investigate the regulation of this association we used phosphatase inhibitors to increase phosphotyrosine levels in GCPs. This resulted in the release of c-src from the cytoskeleton.

Cytoskeletally bound c-src had a higher specific kinase activity than Triton X-100-soluble c-src.

This phosphoprotein was identified by probing western blots of 32P-labeled soluble proteins from P. hollandica with an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine. This specificity was confirmed by competition experiments in which the antibody binding was abolished completely in the presence of excess phosphotyrosine but not phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The kinetics of phosphorylation in vivo were determined by probing western blots with this antibody. Within 1 h following a switch from extended darkness to high light (200 [mu]mol photons m-2 s-1), the 88-kD protein was detectable upon India ink staining of western blots. After 3 h, the antibody recognized the phosphorylated form of this polypeptide. Within 6 h of a downshift from high to low light, the 88-kD protein was dephosphorylated. In vitro phosphorylation studies also showed that cell extracts can phosphorylate a tyrosine-containing artificial substrate; acid hydrolysis of both the artificial substrate and the 88-kD protein showed that phosphorylation occurred exclusively on tyrosine residues.

Methyl esterification significantly increases the relative signal intensity generated by phosphopeptides in negative ion mode compared with positive ion mode and greatly increases selectivity for phosphopeptides by suppressing the signal intensity generated by acidic peptides in negative ion mode.

As one of the most studied post-translational modifications (PTM), protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in almost all cellular processes. Current methods are able to predict and determine thousands of phosphorylation sites, whereas stoichiometric quantification of these sites is still challenging. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based targeted proteomics is emerging as a promising technique for site-specific quantification of protein phosphorylation using proteolytic peptides as surrogates of proteins. However, several issues may limit its application, one of which relates to the phosphopeptides with different phosphorylation sites and the same mass (i.e., isobaric phosphopeptides). While employment of site-specific product ions allows for these isobaric phosphopeptides to be distinguished and quantified, site-specific product ions are often absent or weak in tandem mass spectra. In this study, linear algebra algorithms were employed as an add-on to targeted proteomics to retrieve information on individual phosphopeptides from their common spectra. To achieve this simultaneous quantification, a LC-MS/MS-based targeted proteomics assay was first developed and validated for each phosphopeptide. Given the slope and intercept of calibration curves of phosphopeptides in each transition, linear algebraic equations were developed. Using a series of mock mixtures prepared with varying concentrations of each phosphopeptide, the reliability of the approach to quantify isobaric phosphopeptides containing multiple phosphorylation sites (\u2265 2) was discussed.

Phosphotyrosine MIPs were tested against a mixture of peptides and phosphopeptides by performing micro-solid phase extraction using MIPs (\u03bcMISPE) packed in a pipette tip. First, the capability of the materials to preferentially enrich phosphopeptides was evaluated. In a next step, the enrichment of phosphopeptides from a whole-cell lysate of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells was performed. The eluates were analyzed using MALDI-MS in the first case and with nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in the second case. The results showed that the MIPs provided affinity for phosphopeptides, binding preferentially to multi-site phosphorylated peptides. The MIPs could enrich phosphopeptides in over 10-fold compared with the number of phosphopeptides found in a cell lysate without enrichment.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 138, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 291, "charStart": 140}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 491, "charStart": 293}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 617, "charStart": 493}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 696, "charStart": 619}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 824, "charStart": 698}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1031, "charStart": 826}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1202, "charStart": 1033}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1297, "charStart": 1204}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1430, "charStart": 1299}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1538, "charStart": 1432}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1672, "charStart": 1540}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1813, "charStart": 1674}], "mesh": ["Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Humans", "Molecular Imprinting", "Nanoparticles", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Polymers", "Silicon Dioxide", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Animals implanted for chronic polysomnographic recordings were sacrificed after either 3h of sleep or 3h of sleep deprivation by gentle handling. Anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine staining was mainly localized in neurons and was high in some brain regions, such as cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and low in others, such as the thalamus.

Unilateral lesions of the locus coeruleus by local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine were performed in other animals to determine whether the increase in protein phosphorylation during waking was influenced by the activity of the noradrenergic system, which is higher in waking than in sleep.

Similarly, all the peptides containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid are present in the EDTA extract and none in the insoluble residue, confirming that none is covalently linked to chicken bone collagen. However, organic phosphorus is also found to be present in chicken bone collagen, principally in the alpha2-chains. Of the total protein-bound organic phosphorus present in chicken bone matrix, approx. 80% is associated with the non-collagenous proteins and 20% with collagen. The soluble non-collagenous proteins contain both O-phosphoserine and O-phosphothreonine and these account for essentially of their organic phosphorus content. In contrast, collagen contains neither O-phosphoserine nor O-phosphothreonine. Indeed, no phosphorylated hydroxy amino acid, phosphoamidated amino acid or phosphorylated sugar could be identified in purified components of collagen, which contain approximately four to five atoms of organic phosphorus per molecule of collagen.

These data, the very high concentrations of glutamic acid in the phosphorylated peptides, and the pH-stability of the organic phosphorus moiety in intact collagen chains strongly suggest that at least part of the organic phosphorus in collagen is present as phosphorylated glutamic acid.

Cdc14 is a dual-specificity phosphatase that regulates nuclear behavior by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine in fungi. Previously, Cdc14 was shown to act as a positive regulator of cytokinesis, asexual development and multiple stress responses in Beauveria bassiana, a fungal insect pathogen. This study seeks to gain deep insight into a pivotal role of Cdc14 in the signaling network of B. bassiana by analyzing the Cdc14-specific proteome and phosphoproteome generated by the 8-plex iTRAQ labeling and MS/MS analysis of peptides and phosphopeptides. Under normal conditions, 154 proteins and 86 phosphorylation sites in 67 phosphoproteins were upregulated in \u0394cdc14 versus wild-type, whereas 117 proteins and 85 phosphorylation sites in 58 phosphoproteins were significantly downregulated. Co-cultivation of \u0394cdc14 with NaCl (1 M), H2O2 (3 mM) and Congo red (0.15 mg/ml) resulted in the upregulation / downregulation of 23/63, 41/39 and 79/79 proteins and of 127/112, 52/47 and 105/226 phosphorylation sites in 85/92, 45/36 and 79/146 phosphoproteins, respectively.

We have developed a method to isolate and enhance the detection of phosphopeptides using liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry on a tryptic-digested protein sample. The method uses an on-line two-dimensional chromatography approach that consists of strong cation exchange (SCX) followed by reversed-phase (RP) chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. At pH 2.6 or lower, tryptic phosphopeptides are not retained during the first-dimension SCX chromatography step. Thus the capture of these peptides in the flow-through by the second-dimension RP trap can dramatically reduce the complexity of the phosphopeptide chromatography, resulting in little or no suppression of the signal often caused by the coeluting nonphosphorylated peptides. The method provides higher phosphopeptide recovery and less nonspecific biding of acidic peptides than the commonly used enrichment methods, such as immobilized metal affinity chromatography.

The use of phospho/dephosphopeptide retention time ratios allows the identification of phosphopeptides with high confidence with the aid of a focused database of dephosphopeptides. This approach was very effective to identify multiple phophorylations in tryptic peptides.

Dissociation of the neutral loss product ion identifies peptide sequence.

The complete characterization of phosphorylated proteins requires an efficient procedure for the enrichment of phosphopeptides from amongst a complicated peptide mixture. The sensitivity of the traditional immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) approach is severely affected by various buffers, detergents and other reagents normally utilized in biochemical and cell biological procedures, and thus pre-purification steps such as reversed-phase chromatography is required prior to phosphopeptide enrichment. Here we evaluate the use of different 'non-phosphopeptide-excluding compounds' in the loading buffer for titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) chromatography and show that TiO(2) is more robust and tolerant towards many reagents, including salts, detergents and other low molecular mass molecules, than conventional IMAC. In addition, we show that the inclusion of various detergents can enhance the efficiency of this enrichment method, as phosphopeptides that otherwise adhere to plastic surfaces can be efficiently solubilized and subsequently purified. The TiO(2) chromatography technique is also compared to zirconium dioxide chromatography for phosphopeptide enrichment.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 106, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 277, "charStart": 108}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 624, "charStart": 279}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 934, "charStart": 626}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1169, "charStart": 936}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1289, "charStart": 1171}], "mesh": ["Animals", "Cattle", "Chromatography, Affinity", "Detergents", "Humans", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Solubility", "Titanium", "Zirconium"], "type": ["Comparative Study", "Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}
{"text": "Amorphous TiO2 Nanotubes as a Platform for Highly Selective Phosphopeptide Enrichment. This work reports highly selective phosphopeptide enrichment using amorphous TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2NTs) and the same material decorated with superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs). TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs materials were applied for phosphopeptide enrichment both from a simple peptide mixture (tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin and \u03b1-casein) and from a complex peptide mixture (tryptic digest of Jurkat T cell lysate). The obtained enrichment efficiency and selectivity for phosphopeptides of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs were increased to 28.7 and 25.3%, respectively, as compared to those of the well-established TiO2 microspheres. The enrichment protocol was extended for a second elution step facilitating the identification of additional phosphopeptides. It further turned out that both types of amorphous TiO2 nanotubes provide qualitatively new physicochemical features that are clearly advantageous for highly selective phosphopeptide enrichment. This has been confirmed experimentally resulting in substantial reduction of non-phosphorylated peptides in the enriched samples. In addition, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs combine high selectivity and ease of handling due to the superparamagnetic character of the material. The presented materials and performances are further promising for applications toward a whole range of other types of biomolecules to be treated in a similar fashion.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 85}, "docId": "31460330", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 85, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 282, "charStart": 87}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 530, "charStart": 284}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 745, "charStart": 532}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 871, "charStart": 747}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1066, "charStart": 873}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1196, "charStart": 1068}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1328, "charStart": 1198}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1496, "charStart": 1330}]}

Protein phosphorylation, one of the most important protein post-translational modifications, is involved in various biological processes, and the identification of phosphorylation peptides (phosphopeptides) and their corresponding phosphorylation sites (phosphosites) will facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism and function of phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides a high-throughput technology that enables the identification of large numbers of phosphosites. PhoPepMass is designed to assist human phosphopeptide identification from MS data based on a specific database of phophopeptide masses and a multivariate hypergeometric matching algorithm. It contains 244,915 phosphosites from several public sources. Moreover, the accurate masses of peptides and fragments with phosphosites were calculated. It is the first database that provides a systematic resource for the query of phosphosites on peptides and their corresponding masses. This allows researchers to search certain proteins of which phosphosites have been reported, to browse detailed phosphopeptide and fragment information, to match masses from MS analyses with defined threshold to the corresponding phosphopeptide, and to compare proprietary phosphopeptide discovery results with results from previous studies. Additionally, a database search software is created and a \"two-stage search strategy\" is suggested to identify phosphopeptides from tandem mass spectra of proteomics data. We expect PhoPepMass to be a useful tool and a source of reference for proteomics researchers.

We constructed a strain carrying a deletion in spvC and showed that the strain is attenuated for systemic virulence in mice. SpvC can be secreted in vitro by either the SPI-1 or SPI-2 type III secretion systems.
