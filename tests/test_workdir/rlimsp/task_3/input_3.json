This light response is observed whether the red light irradiation is given to pea plumules or nuclei isolated from the plumules. The red-light-induced response seen in plumules is reversible by a subsequent far-red-light irradiation, indicating that the likely photoreceptor for this response may be phytochrome. By immunoblot analysis pea phytochrome A, but not phytochrome B, can be detected in proteins extracted from pea nuclear chromatin-matrix preparations. Phytochrome A and the protein bands immunostained by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies can be solubilized from unirradiated pea chromatin by 0.3 M NaCl, but irradiating this preparation with red light does not induce the appearance of phosphotyrosine-like epitopes in any nuclear proteins.

In this study, we propose a simple and highly sensitive method for phosphopeptide enrichment on NiO nanoparticles (NPs) from a trypsin predigested phosphoprotein complex solution in a microwave oven. Furthermore, this technique was combined with centrifugation on-particle ionization/enrichment of phosphopeptides and phosphopeptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Weak magnetism of these NPs and a positive surface charge effect at low pH accomplished rapid and selective phosphopeptide enrichment within 30s. Trypsin-digested products of phosphoproteins such as \u03b1-casein and \u03b2-casein, human blood serum, nonfat milk, and egg white were also investigated to explore their phosphopeptide enrichment from complex samples by this approach. The results demonstrate that NiO NPs exhibit good affinity to trace the phosphopeptides even in the presence of 30 times higher molar concentration of complex solution of non-phosphopeptide proteolytic predigested bovine serum albumin.

NiO NPs were found to be effective and selective for enrichment of singly and multiply phosphorylated peptides at a trace level in complex samples in a microwave oven.

Tryptic and chymotryptic phosphopeptide maps of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of LC20 purified from skinned muscles demonstrated the presence of a single phosphopeptide in all cases. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that the monophosphorylated form contained primarily phosphoserine, whereas the diphosphorylated form contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Thiophosphorylation of LC20 by adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) resulted in the incorporation of 1 mol of thiophosphate into phosphoserine.

Highly virulent strains of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that delivers the effector protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by members of the oncogenic c-Src and c-Abl host kinases at EPIYA-sequence motifs A, B and D in East Asian-type strains. These phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs serve as recognition sites for various SH2-domains containing human proteins, mediating interactions of CagA with host signaling factors to manipulate signal transduction pathways. Recognition of phospho-CagA is mainly based on the use of commercial pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies that were originally designed to detect phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. Specific anti-phospho-EPIYA antibodies for each of the three sites in CagA are not forthcoming. This study was designed to systematically analyze the detection preferences of each phosphorylated East Asian CagA EPIYA-motif by pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies and to determine a minimal recognition sequence. We synthesized phospho- and non-phosphopeptides derived from each predominant EPIYA-site, and determined the recognition patterns by seven different pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies using Western blotting, and also investigated representative East Asian H. pylori isolates during infection. The results indicate that a total of only 9-11 amino acids containing the phosphorylated East Asian EPIYA-types are required and sufficient to detect the phosphopeptides with high specificity. However, the sequence recognition by the different antibodies was found to bear high variability. From the seven antibodies used, only four recognized all three phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs A, B and D similarly well. Two of the phosphotyrosine antibodies preferentially bound primarily to the phosphorylated motif A and D, while the seventh antibody failed to react with any of the phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs. Control experiments confirmed that none of the antibodies reacted with non-phospho-CagA peptides and in accordance were able to recognize phosphotyrosine proteins in human cells.

{"text": "Influence of the metals and ligands in dinuclear complexes on phosphopeptide sequencing by electron-transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation is one of the most important protein modifications, and electron-transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (ETD-MS/MS) is a potentially useful method for the sequencing of phosphopeptides, including determination of the phosphorylation site. Notably, ETD-MS/MS typically provides useful information when the precursor contains more than three positive charges. It is not yet used as an analysis method for large-scale phosphopeptide production due to difficulties occurring in the production of acidic phosphopeptides having more than three positive charges. To increase the charge state of phosphopeptides, we used dinuclear metal complexes, which selectively bind to the phosphate group in phosphopeptides with the addition of positive charge(s). Dinuclear copper, zinc, and gallium complexes were tested and it was found that the type of metal present in the complex strongly affected the affinity of the phosphorylated compounds and their ETD fragmentation. The dinuclear copper complex interacted weakly with the phosphate groups and ETD-induced peptide fragmentation was largely suppressed by the presence of Cu2+, which worked as an electron trap. The dinuclear gallium complex was strongly bound to a phosphate group. However, the ligand binding to gallium acted as an electron trap and the presence of dinuclear gallium complex in the precursor for ETD-MS/MS hampered the sequencing of the phosphopeptides, as in the case of dinuclear copper complexes. In contrast, dinuclear zinc complexes efficiently bind to phosphopeptides with an increase in the charge state, facilitating phosphopeptide sequencing by ETD-MS/MS. The fragmentation of the ligand and peptide backbone in the dinuclear zinc-phosphopeptide complex were competitively induced by ETD. These processes are influenced by the ligand structure and so the detailed ETD fragmentation pathways were investigated using density functional theory calculations.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 146}, "docId": "30310898", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 146, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 409, "charStart": 148}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 528, "charStart": 411}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 726, "charStart": 530}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 916, "charStart": 728}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1129, "charStart": 918}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1322, "charStart": 1131}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1393, "charStart": 1324}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1629, "charStart": 1395}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1794, "charStart": 1631}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1927, "charStart": 1796}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2093, "charStart": 1929}]}
{"text": "Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Large-Scale Phosphoproteomics with the Production of over 11,000 Phosphopeptides from the Colon Carcinoma HCT116 Cell Line. Phosphoproteomics requires better separation of phosphopeptides to boost the coverage of the phosphoproteome. We argue that an alternative separation method that produces orthogonal phosphopeptide separation to the widely used LC needs to be considered. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is one important alternative because CZE and LC are orthogonal for phosphopeptide separation and because the migration time of peptides in CZE can be accurately predicted. In this work, we coupled strong cation exchange (SCX)-reversed-phase LC (RPLC) to CZE-MS/MS for large-scale phosphoproteomics of the colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line. The CZE-MS/MS-based platform identified 11,555 phosphopeptides. The phosphopeptide data set is at least 100% larger than that from previous CZE-MS/MS studies and will be a valuable resource for building a model for predicting the migration time of phosphopeptides in CZE. Phosphopeptides migrate significantly slower than corresponding unphosphopeptides under acidic conditions of CZE separations and in a normal polarity. According to our modeling data, phosphorylation decreases peptide's charge roughly by one charge unit, resulting in dramatic decrease in electrophoretic mobility. Preliminary investigations demonstrate that electrophoretic mobility of phosphopeptides containing one phosphoryl group can be predicted with the same accuracy as for nonmodified peptides ( R2 \u2248 0.99). The CZE-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS were complementary in large-scale phosphopeptide identifications and produced different phosphosite motifs from the HCT116 cell line. The data highlight the value of CZE-MS/MS for phosphoproteomics as a complementary separation approach for not only improving the phosphoproteome coverage but also providing more insight into the phosphosite motifs.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 182}, "docId": "30624053", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 182, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 292, "charStart": 184}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 436, "charStart": 294}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 645, "charStart": 438}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 812, "charStart": 647}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 876, "charStart": 814}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1084, "charStart": 878}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1235, "charStart": 1086}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1398, "charStart": 1237}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1600, "charStart": 1400}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1761, "charStart": 1602}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1977, "charStart": 1763}]}

This increase was significantly inhibited by trifluoperazine (25 or 50 microM), an antagonist of calmodulin.

Protein phosphatase activity towards three phosphoamino acids was significantly increased in the presence of anti-regucalcin monoclonal antibody (25 or 50 ng/ml) in the enzyme reaction mixture. This effect was completely blocked by the addition of regucalcin (100 nM). The effect of antibody (25 ng/ml) in increasing protein phosphatase activity towards phosphotyrosine was significantly inhibited by vanadate (10(-4) M).

The ptp gene of Acinetobacter johnsonii was previously reported to encode a low-molecular-mass protein, Ptp, whose amino acid sequence, predicted from the theoretical analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the gene, exhibits a high degree of similarity with those of different eukaryotic and prokaryotic phosphotyrosine-protein phophatases. We have now overexpressed the ptp gene in Escherichia coli cells, purified the Ptp protein to homogeneity by a single-step chromatographic procedure, and analysed its functional properties. We have shown that Ptp can catalyse the dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phosphotyrosine, but has no effect on phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. Its activity is blocked by ammonium molybdate and sodium orthovanadate, which are strong inhibitors of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases, as well as by N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetic acid. Such specificity of Ptp for phosphotyrosine has been confirmed by the observation that it can dephosphorylate endogenous proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine, but not proteins modified on either serine or threonine. In addition, Ptp has been shown to quantitatively dephosphorylate two exogenous peptides, derived respectively from leech hirudin and human gastrin, previously phosphorylated on tyrosine. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments performed on Cys11 and Arg16, which are both present in the sequence motif (H/V)C(X5)R(S/T) typical of eukaryotic phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases, have demonstrated that each amino acid residue is essential for the catalytic activity of Ptp. Taken together, these data provide evidence that Ptp is a member of the phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase family. Furthermore, in search for the biological function of Ptp, we have found that it can specifically dephosphorylate an endogenous protein kinase, termed Ptk, which is known to autophosphorylate at multiple tyrosine residues in the inner membrane of Acinetobacter johnsonii cells.

Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine 527 increases Src kinase activity. Candidate phosphotyrosine 527 phosphatases include cytoplasmic PTP1B, Shp1 and Shp2, and transmembrane enzymes include CD45, PTPalpha, PTPepsilon, and PTPlambda. Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine 416 decreases Src kinase activity. Thus far PTP-BL, the mouse homologue of human PTP-BAS, has been shown to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine 416 in a regulatory fashion. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor protein-tyrosine kinase mediates the phosphorylation of Src Tyr138; this phosphorylation has no direct effect on Src kinase activity.

Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been demonstrated to enrich phosphopeptides from simple peptide mixtures with high specificity; however, the technology has not been optimized. In the present study, significant non-specific bindings were observed when proteome samples were applied to TiO2 columns. Column wash with an NH4Glu solution after loading peptide mixtures significantly increased the efficiency of TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment with a recovery of up to 84%. Also, for proteome samples, more than a 2-fold increase in unique phosphopeptide identifications has been achieved. The use of NH4Glu for a TiO2 column wash does not significantly reduce the phosphopeptide recovery. A total of 858 phosphopeptides corresponding to 1034 distinct phosphosites has been identified from HeLa cells using the improved TiO2 enrichment procedure in combination with data-dependent neutral loss nano-RPLC-MS2-MS3 analysis. While 41 and 35% of the phosphopeptides were identified only by MS2 and MS3, respectively, 24% was identified by both MS2 and MS3. Cross-validation of the phosphopeptide assignment by MS2 and MS3 scans resulted in the highest confidence in identification (99.5%).

In the present work, we demostrate that the phosphopeptide enrichment method based on an online continuous pH gradient in a strong anion exchange column (SAX method) is highly complementary to the method based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) affinity enrichment.

Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a common theme in the regulation of important cellular functions such as growth, metabolism, and differentiation.

Although, the number of cellular phosphoproteins is relatively high, the phosphorylated residues themselves are generally of low abundance due to the sub-stoichiometric nature. However, low abundance of phosphopeptides and low degree of phosphorylation typically necessitates isolation and concentration of phosphopeptides prior to mass spectrometric analysis.

In this paper we present methods for identifying and sequencing phosphopeptides in simple mixtures, such as HPLC fractions, at the subpicomole level by (+) ion matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Data are presented which indicate that when a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer is used, MALDI can distinguish tyrosine phosphorylation from serine and threonine phosphorylation for peptides containing a single phosphate group. Phosphopeptides are identified in the (+) ion MALDI reflector spectrum by the presence of [MH-H3PO4]+ and [MH-HPO3]+ fragment ions formed by metastable decomposition. An abundant [MH-H3PO4]+ ion, accompanied by a weaker [MH-HPO3]+ ion indicates that the peptide is most likely phosphorylated on serine or threonine. In contrast, phosphotyrosine-containing peptides generally exhibit [MH-HPO3]+ fragment ions and little, if any [MH-H3PO4]+.

In yeast and human, many proteins containing an FHA domain are found in the nucleus and involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or pre-mRNA processing. In plants, the FHA domain is part of a protein that is localized to the plasma membrane and participates in the regulation of receptor-like protein kinase signaling pathways. Recent studies show that a functional FHA domain consists of 120-140 amino acid residues, which is significantly larger than the sequence motif first described. Although FHA domains do not exhibit extensive sequence similarity, they share similar secondary and tertiary structures, featuring a sandwich of two anti-parallel (beta)-sheets.

The magnetite microparticles show excellent magnetic responsivity and redispersibility for a quick enrichment of those phosphopeptides in solution. The selectivity and sensitivity of magnetite microparticles in phosphopeptide enrichment are first evaluated by a known mixture containing both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins.

Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism and cellular survival, and consequently mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a number of human pathologies. Reversible protein phosphorylation emerges as a central mechanism in the regulation of several mitochondrial processes. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to insulin resistance in humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We performed a phosphoproteomics study of functional mitochondria isolated from human muscle biopsies with the aim to obtain a comprehensive overview of mitochondrial phosphoproteins. Combining an efficient mitochondrial isolation protocol with several different phosphopeptide enrichment techniques and LC-MS/MS, we identified 155 distinct phosphorylation sites in 77 mitochondrial phosphoproteins, including 116 phosphoserine, 23 phosphothreonine, and 16 phosphotyrosine residues. The relatively high number of phosphotyrosine residues suggests an important role for tyrosine phosphorylation in mitochondrial signaling. Many of the mitochondrial phosphoproteins are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and lipid metabolism, i.e. processes proposed to be involved in insulin resistance. We also assigned phosphorylation sites in mitochondrial proteins involved in amino acid degradation, importers and transporters, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis. Bioinformatics analysis of kinase motifs revealed that many of these mitochondrial phosphoproteins are substrates for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and DNA-dependent protein kinase.

The Na/Cl-dependent BGT1 transporter has osmoprotective functions by importing the small osmolyte betaine into the cytosol of renal medullary epithelial cells. We have demonstrated previously that the surface localization of the transporter in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells depends on its association with the LIN7 PDZ protein through a PDZ target sequence in the last 5 residues of the transporter (-KETHL). Here we describe a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated mechanism regulating the association between BGT1 and LIN7. Reduced transport activity paralleled by the intracellular relocalization of the transporter was observed in response to the PKC activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment. This activation caused clathrin-dependent internalization of the transporter and its targeting to a recycling compartment that contains the truncated transporter lacking the LIN7 binding motif (BGTDelta5) but not the LIN7 partner of BGT1. The decreased association between BGT1 and LIN7 was demonstrated further by coimmunoprecipitation studies and in vitro binding to recombinant LIN7 fusion protein. The TPA treatment induced phosphorylation of surface BGT1 on serine and threonine residues. However, a greater increase in phosphothreonines than phosphoserines was measured in the wild type transporter, whereas the opposite was true in the BGTSer mutant in which a serine replaced the threonine 612 in the LIN7 association motif (-KESHL). No similar increase in relative phosphoserines or phosphothreonines was found in the BGTDelta5 transporter. Moreover, phosphorylation of threonine 612 in a BGT COOH-terminal peptide impaired its association with recombinant LIN7.

In this review, I will discuss how phosphatases were discovered, how the view that they were unselective emerged and how recent findings have revealed their exquisite selectivity. Unlike kinases, PP1 phosphatases are obligatory heteromers composed of a catalytic subunit bound to one (or two) non-catalytic subunit(s).

Because functional complementation of the two modules is required to produce a selective holophosphatase, one can consider that they are split enzymes. The non-catalytic subunit was often referred to as a regulatory subunit, but it is, in fact, an essential component of the holoenzyme.

To prevent loss of granule-associated phosphoproteins upon exocytosis, neutrophils were pretreated with a TAT-fusion protein containing a SNARE domain from SNAP-23 (TAT-SNAP-23), which inhibited fMLF-stimulated CD66b-containing granule exocytosis by 100\u00b110%. Following TAT-SNAP-23 pretreatment, neutrophils were stimulated with the chemotactic peptide fMLF for 0 min, 1 min, and 2 min. Granules were isolated by gradient centrifugation and subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin to obtain peptides from the outer surface of the granule. Phosphopeptides were enriched by gallium or TiO2 affinity chromatography, and phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites were identified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem MS. This resulted in the identification of 243 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 235 proteins, including known regulators of vesicle trafficking. The analysis identified 79 phosphoproteins from resting neutrophils, 81 following 1 min of fMLF stimulation, and 118 following 2 min of stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis identified a potential Src tyrosine kinase motif from a phosphopeptide corresponding to G protein coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5). Phosphorylation of GRK5 by Src was confirmed by an in vitro kinase reaction and by precursor ion scanning for phospho-tyrosine specific immonium ions containing Tyr251 and Tyr253. Immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated GRK5 from intact cells was reduced by a Src inhibitor. In conclusion, targets of signal transduction pathways were identified that are candidates to regulate neutrophil granule exocytosis.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 117, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 255, "charStart": 119}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 362, "charStart": 257}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 487, "charStart": 364}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 574, "charStart": 489}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 832, "charStart": 576}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1091, "charStart": 834}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1218, "charStart": 1093}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1394, "charStart": 1220}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1770, "charStart": 1396}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1919, "charStart": 1772}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2074, "charStart": 1921}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2254, "charStart": 2076}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 2347, "charStart": 2256}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2481, "charStart": 2349}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Chemotaxis", "Computational Biology", "Cytoplasmic Granules", "Exocytosis", "G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5", "Gene Products, tat", "Humans", "Molecular Sequence Data", "N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine", "Neutrophil Activation", "Neutrophils", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Qb-SNARE Proteins", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "SNARE Proteins", "Time Factors", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "src-Family Kinases"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}

IMAC strategy is widely used in phosphopeptide enrichment, but most of the current eluents contain large amount of salt, which must be discarded before MS detection. Here, we present techniques to elute phosphopeptides with low ionization efficiency reagents, which could be left in the eluate for direct MS analysis, thus saving desalting and the following steps. Several reagents were studied, including 5-sulfosalicylic acid dihydrate, acetyl acetone and glyphosate. The results show that glyphosate has very outstanding advantages: only monophosphopeptides can be eluted with glyphosate solution, while all phosphopeptides can be eluted with negatively charged glyphosate ions with pH9. Moreover, the high ionic strength can minimize nonspecific electrostatic interactions in elution step and limit the generation of potential phosphopeptide-metal ion adducts such as sodium or Fe(3+) counterparts. S/N of phosphopeptides could be enhanced 3-5 folds in MALDI MS detection and phosphopeptide recovery is greatly improved while compared with its counterparts eluted by commonly used elution buffers. By applying this reagent into IMAC elution, the whole experimental process could be more convenient, time-saving and cost-saving, which is of great importance to the enrichment and detection of phosphopeptides in phosphoproteomics research. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This potent desalting-free and signal enhanced elution method can improve the sensitivity and detection of phosphopeptides in MALDI TOF MS analysis, both time saving and cost saving.

Furthermore, it appears to be a conserved property of all Cdc14 family phosphatases. An invariant active site residue was identified that sterically restricts phosphothreonine binding and is largely responsible for phosphoserine selectivity. Optimal Cdc14 substrates also possessed a basic residue at the +3 position relative to the phosphoserine, whereas substrates lacking this basic residue were not effectively hydrolyzed.

It has been shown previously that the CSF-1 receptor is phosphorylated on serine in vivo and that phosphorylation on tyrosine can be induced by stimulation with CSF-1. We studied the phosphorylation of the CSF-1 receptor by using the BAC1.2F5 murine macrophage cell line, which naturally expresses CSF-1 receptors. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping showed that the CSF-1 receptor is phosphorylated on several different serine residues in vivo. Stimulation with CSF-1 at 37 degrees C resulted in rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine at one major site and one or two minor sites. We identified the major site as Tyr-706. The identity of Tyr-706 was confirmed by mutagenesis. This residue is located within the kinase insert domain. There was no evidence that Tyr-973 (equivalent to Tyr-969 in the human CSF-1 receptor) was phosphorylated following CSF-1 stimulation. When cells were stimulated with CSF-1 at 4 degrees C, additional phosphotyrosine-containing phosphopeptides were detected and the level of phosphorylation of the individual phosphotyrosine-containing phosphopeptides was substantially increased.

Cell signaling pathways rely on phosphotransfer reactions that are catalyzed by protein kinases. The protein kinases themselves are typically regulated by phosphorylation and concurrent structural rearrangements, both near the catalytic site and elsewhere. Thus, physiological function requires posttranslational modification and deformable structures. A prototypical example is provided by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). It is activated by phosphorylation, is inhomogeneously phosphorylated when expressed in bacteria, and exhibits a wide range of dynamic properties. Here we use (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the phosphorylation states and to estimate the flexibility of the phosphorylation sites of 2-, 3-, and 4-fold phosphorylated PKA. The phosphorylation sites Ser10, Ser139, Thr197, and Ser338 are assigned to individual NMR resonances, assisted by complexation with AMP-PNP and dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Rotational diffusion correlation times estimated from resonance line widths show progressively increasing flexibilities for phosphothreonine 197, phosphoserines 139 and 338, and disorder at phosphoserine 10, consistent with crystal structures of PKA. However, because the apparent rotational diffusion correlation time fitted for phosphothreonine 197 of the activation loop is longer than the overall PKA rotational diffusion time, microsecond to millisecond time scale conformational exchange effects involving motions of phosphothreonine 197 are probable. These may represent \"open\"-\"closed\" transitions of the uncomplexed protein in solution.

The phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (PTPase) specificity of phosphotyrosyl-phosphatase-activator-(PTPA)-stimulated protein phosphatase (PP)2A(D) (rabbit muscle) and a bona fide PTP-1B (Xenopus laevis oocytes) were examined in vitro using phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, derived from the phosphorylation sites of p34cdc2, p50/HS1 protein, Abl, c-Src and c-Fgr, as well as the intact phosphoprotein p50/HS1 and the Src-related tyrosine kinases, Lyn and c-Fgr. The local specificity determinants were found to be different for both PTPases. The length of the phosphopeptides is more important for PP2A(D) than for PTP-1B, C-terminal acidic residues adjacent to the phosphotyrosine are detrimental for the PTPase activity of PP2A(D), but they do not affect the PTP-1B activity. Acidic residues at the --2 and --3 position relative to Tyr(P) primarily dictate dephosphorylation by PTP-1B. The higher-order structure of the protein substrates also differentially influences both enzymes: the phospho-octapeptide KDDEYpNPA, which reproduces the autophosphorylation site in c-Fgr (Tyr400), is only dephosphorylated by PP2A(D) if embedded in the intact protein, whereas the opposite is true for PTP-1B. Both the intact p50/HS1 phosphoprotein and the derived phosphopeptide are substrates only for PTP-1B and not for PP2A(D).

The mechanism for these dephosphorylation reactions was investigated. Dephosphorylation was inhibited by a competitive inhibitor for the ATP binding site. In the presence of ADP, dephosphorylation of phosphopeptide substrates is primarily due to the reversal of the kinase reaction. Autoactivated and unactivated srcTK both catalyzed the reverse of the kinase reaction; however, autoactivated srcTK displayed an increase in kcat of approximately 4-11-fold relative to unactivated srcTK, depending on the reaction conditions. Autoactivation of srcTK does not affect the Km's for MgADP or phosphopeptide (FGE)3-pY-(GEF)2GD.

The binding of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains to tyrosyl phosphopeptides depends on electrostatic interactions between the phosphotyrosine and its binding site. To probe the role of these interactions, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the pH dependence of the binding of the SH2 domain of the Src kinase to a high-affinity tyrosyl phosphopeptide. Two independent approaches were employed. In a first series of experiments that focused on determining the peptide's association constant between pH 5.0 and 9.0, two ionizable groups were characterized. One group, with free and bound pKas of 6.2 and 4.4, respectively, could be identified as the phosphate in the phosphotyrosine while the other group, with free and bound pKas of 8.2 and 8.5, respectively, could be only tentatively assigned to a cysteine in the phosphotyrosine binding pocket. Further information on the linkage between peptide binding and protonation of the phosphotyrosine was obtained from a second series of experiments, which focused on determining the peptide binding enthalpy at low values of pH in several buffers with different ionization enthalpies. These data provided free and bound pKa values for the phosphotyrosine identical to those derived from the first series of experiments, and hence demonstrated for the first time that the two approaches provide identical information regarding proton linkage. In addition, the second series of experiments also determined the intrinsic enthalpy of binding of both the protonated and deprotonated phosphate forms of the peptide. These two sets of experiments provided a complete energetic profile of the linkage between phosphate ionization and peptide binding.

In the infancy of studies on protein phosphorylation the occurrence of clusters of three or more consecutive phosphoseryl residues in secreted and in cellular phosphoproteins was reported.

Nowadays, in the post-genomic era, the availability of large phosphoproteomics database makes possible a comprehensive re-visitation of this intriguing aspect of protein phosphorylation, aimed at shedding light on both its mechanistic occurrence and its functional meaning. Here we describe an analysis of the human phosphoproteome disclosing the existence of more than 800 rows of 3 to >10 consecutive phosphoamino acids, composed almost exclusively of phosphoserine, while clustered phosphothreonines and phosphotyrosines are almost absent. A scrutiny of these phosphorylated rows supports the conclusion that they are generated through the major contribution of a few hierarchical protein kinases, with special reference to CK2. Also well documented is the combined intervention of CK1 and GSK3, the former acting as priming and primed, the latter as primed kinase.

PURPOSE: A major pathway for intracellular signaling from cell surface receptors, such as integrins, involves intracellular phosphorylation. In corneal fibroblasts, the authors have investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin-dependent cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. METHODS: Antibodies were used to detect phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, including focal adhesion kinase in lysates and immunoprecipitates of corneal fibroblasts. The authors used anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to localize phosphotyrosines in fixed cultured corneal fibroblasts. Similarly, immunocytochemical detection of vinculin was used to identify focal adhesions, the subcellular structures in which integrins organize attachment to matrix extracellularly and to cytoskeletal components intracellularly. RESULTS: Suspension of corneal fibroblasts produced a dramatic decrease in detectable phosphotyrosines. During integrin-dependent fibroblast attachment to exogenously supplied fibronectin, the cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), pp125FAK, became tyrosine phosphorylated. However, FAK was not phosphorylated during fibroblast attachment to vitronectin or polylysine or when cells were kept in suspension. In addition, the treatment of suspended cells with antibody to the extracellular domain of fibronectin receptor caused FAK phosphorylation. Phosphotyrosine was colocalized with vinculin in newly formed focal adhesions. Focal adhesion formation was prevented by herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases.

{"text": "Enzyme-Instructed Self-Assembly of Peptides Containing Phosphoserine to Form Supramolecular Hydrogels as Potential Soft Biomaterials. Enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) offers a facile approach to explore the supramolecular assemblies of small molecules in cellular milieu for a variety of biomedical applications. One of the commonly used enzymes is phosphatase, but the study of the substrates of phosphatases mainly focuses on the phosphotyrosine containing peptides. In this work, we examine the EISA of phosphoserine containing small peptides for the first time by designing and synthesizing a series of precursors containing only phosphoserine or both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. Conjugating a phosphoserine to the C-terminal of a well-established self-assembling peptide backbone, (naphthalene-2-ly)-acetyl-diphenylalanine (NapFF), affords a novel hydrogelation precursor for EISA. The incorporation of phosphotyrosine, another substrate of phosphatase, into the resulting precursor, provides one more enzymatic trigger on a single molecule, and meanwhile increases the precursors' propensity to aggregate after being fully dephosphorylated. Exchanging the positions of phosphorylated serine and tyrosine in the peptide backbone provides insights on how the specific molecular structures influence self-assembling behaviors of small peptides and the subsequent cellular responses.

Phosphoamino acid analysis of eNOS from bovine aortic endothelial cells labeled with [(32)P]orthophosphate demonstrated that only phosphoserine was present in eNOS under both static and flow conditions. Fluid shear stress induced phosphate incorporation into two specific eNOS tryptic peptides as early as 30 s after initiation of flow. The flow-induced tryptic phosphopeptides were enriched, separated by capillary electrophoresis with intermittent voltage drops, also known as \"peak parking,\" and analyzed by collision-induced dissociation in a tandem mass spectrometer. Two phosphopeptide sequences determined by tandem mass spectrometry, TQpSFSLQER and KLQTRPpSPGPPPAEQLLSQAR, were confirmed as the two flow-dependent phosphopeptides by co-migration with synthetic phosphopeptides. Because the sequence (RIR)TQpSFSLQER contains a consensus substrate site for protein kinase B (PKB or Akt), we demonstrated that LY294002, an inhibitor of the upstream activator of PKB, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibited flow-induced eNOS phosphorylation by 97% and NO production by 68%.

Four commercially available immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) methods for phosphopeptide enrichment were compared using small volumes and concentrations of phosphopeptide mixtures with or without extra-added bovine serum albumin (BSA) nonphosphorylated peptides. Addition of abundant tryptic BSA peptides to the phosphopeptide mixture increases the demand for selective IMAC capture. While SwellGel gallium Discs, IPAC Metal Chelating Resin, and ZipTipMC Pipette Tips allow for the possibility of enriching phosphopeptides, the Gyrolab MALDI IMAC1 also presents the possibility of verifying existing phosphopeptides after a dephosphorylation step. Phosphate-containing peptides are identified through a mass shift between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated spectra of 80 Da (or multiples of 80 Da). This verification is useful if the degree of phosphorylation is low in the sample or if the ionization is unfavorable, which often is the case for phosphopeptides. A peptide mixture in which phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine were represented was diluted in steps and thereafter enriched using the four different IMAC methods prior to analyses with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The enrichment of phosphopeptides using SwellGel Gallium Discs or Gyrolab MALDI IMAC1 was not significantly affected by the addition of abundant BSA peptides added to the sample mixture, and the achieved detection limits using these techniques were also the lowest.

Furthermore, selectivity, reproducibility, and detection for a number of other phosphopeptides using the IMAC CD are reported herein.

Mass spectrometry is the tool of choice to investigate protein phosphorylation, which plays a vital role in cell regulation and diseases such as cancer. However, low abundances of phosphopeptides and low degrees of phosphorylation typically necessitate isolation and concentration of phosphopeptides prior to MS analysis. This review discusses the enrichment of phosphopeptides with immobilized metal affinity chromatography, reversible covalent binding, and metal oxide affinity chromatography. Capture of phosphopeptides on TiO(2) seems especially promising in terms of selectivity and recovery, but the success of all methods depends on careful selection of binding, washing, and elution solutions. Enrichment techniques are complementary, such that a combination of methods greatly enhances the number of phosphopeptides isolated from complex samples. Development of a standard series of phosphopeptides in a highly complex mixture of digested proteins would greatly aid the comparison of different enrichment methods. Phosphopeptide binding to magnetic beads and on-plate isolation prior to MALDI-MS are emerging as convenient methods for purification of small (microL) samples. On-plate enrichment can yield >70% recoveries of phosphopeptides in mixtures of a few digested proteins and can avoid sample-handling steps, but this technique is likely limited to relatively simple samples such as immunoprecipitates.

In addition, phosphopeptides are generally available in dilute solutions. Thus, methods to specifically identify phosphopeptides at low concentrations are important. In this work, on-line Fe(III) immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)-CE-electrospray ionization MS was developed and applied to sub-pmol analysis of phosphopeptides.

Phosphopeptides were enriched from cultured rat renal proximal tubule cells using three commonly used protocols and a dual method that combines separate immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) chromatography, termed dual IMAC (DIMAC). Phosphopeptides from all four enrichment strategies were analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple levels of mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) neutral-loss scanning using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer.

Recent advances in instrument control and enrichment procedures have enabled us to quantify large numbers of phosphoproteins and record site-specific phosphorylation events. An intriguing problem that has arisen with these advances is to accurately validate where phosphorylation events occur, if possible, in an automated manner. The problem is difficult because MS/MS spectra of phosphopeptides are generally more complicated than those of unmodified peptides. For large scale studies, the problem is even more evident because phosphorylation sites are based on single peptide identifications in contrast to protein identifications where at least two peptides from the same protein are required for identification. To address this problem we have developed an integrated strategy that increases the reliability and ease for phosphopeptide validation. We have developed an off-line titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) selective phosphopeptide enrichment procedure for crude cell lysates. Following enrichment, half of the phosphopeptide fractionated sample is enzymatically dephosphorylated, after which both samples are subjected to LC-MS/MS. From the resulting MS/MS analyses, the dephosphorylated peptide is used as a reference spectrum against the original phosphopeptide spectrum, in effect generating two peptide spectra for the same amino acid sequence, thereby enhancing the probability of a correct identification. The integrated procedure is summarized as follows: 1) enrichment for phosphopeptides by TiO(2) chromatography, 2) dephosphorylation of half the sample, 3) LC-MS/MS-based analysis of phosphopeptides and corresponding dephosphorylated peptides, 4) comparison of peptide elution profiles before and after dephosphorylation to confirm phosphorylation, and 5) comparison of MS/MS spectra before and after dephosphorylation to validate the phosphopeptide and its phosphorylation site. This phosphopeptide identification represents a major improvement as compared with identifications based only on single MS/MS spectra and probability-based database searches.
