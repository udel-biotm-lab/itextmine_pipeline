A comparison of phosphotyrosine peptides enriched by immuno-affinity precipitation and metal-based affinity chromatography. Analysis of tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics remains challenging, due to the low occurrence of this post-translational modification compared to serine and threonine phosphorylation events in mammalian systems. Conventional metal-based affinity chromatography methods used to enrich phosphopeptides can nowadays isolate over 10,000 phosphopeptides. However, these approaches are not particularly suitable for the selective enrichment of low abundant Tyr phosphorylated peptides as the higher abundant co-enriched serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) phosphorylated peptides typically obscure their detection. Therefore, a more targeted approach based on immuno-affinity precipitation at the peptide level has been introduced for the specific analysis of Tyr phosphorylated species. This method typically leads to the detection of a few hundreds of phosphopeptides, albeit typically over 70% of those are Tyr phosphorylated. Here, we evaluated and compared phosphotyrosine peptides enriched by a phospho-Tyr immuno-affinity enrichment (employing pY99 antibodies) and a multidimensional approach consisting of metal-affinity based enrichment (Ti(4+)-IMAC) followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) fractionation. Our aim was to assess differences and similarities in the set of Tyr phosphorylated peptides detected by each approach.

This laboratory has been characterizing protein serine/threonine kinase reactions of hematopoietic tissues, whose most distinguishing characteristics in vitro are stimulation with vesicular phosphatidyl glycerol, and the ability to function using Mn2+ as the sole divalent cation. The major protein substrates are a 73-kD protein and a protein migrating near ovalbumin on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 47-kD protein was partially purified from cells harvested by leukapheresis from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, using ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography.

In the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, the rate of glycoprotein dephosphorylation was also increased three- to four-fold. Gel electrophoretic analysis identified several synaptic membrane glycoproteins that incorporated 32P, with the most highly labeled glycoprotein under basal phosphorylating conditions having an apparent Mr of 205,000 (gpiii).

The phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 by the human erythrocyte membrane kinase and casein kinase A has been investigated. The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was released from erythrocyte vesicles by treatment with alpha-chymotrypsin and isolated as a 43,000-Da peptide. Both the membrane kinase and casein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of about 1 mol of phosphate per mole of the band 3 fragment. The phosphorylation of the band 3 fragment by both kinases was not additive, suggesting that the two enzymes might recognize the same phosphorylation sites. Also in support of this notion was the observation that the phosphopeptide maps of the band 3 fragment phosphorylated by the two kinases were identical. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the band 3 fragment phosphorylated by casein kinase A revealed the presence of approximately equal amounts of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine and, to a lesser extent, phosphotyrosine. The interaction between the 43,000-Da peptide with ankyrin and the effect of phosphorylation on this interaction have been examined. The band 3 fragment was found to form two different types of complexes, termed C1 and C2, with ankyrin in a saturable manner. The C1 and C2 complexes contained about 1.7 and 0.43 mol of band 3 fragment per mole of ankyrin, respectively.

The secretin receptor belongs to a recently recognized family of G protein-coupled receptors that lack the sequence motifs typical of the beta-adrenergic receptor family. Because our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for these receptors is largely based on the latter group, we have begun to explore these mechanisms in the secretin receptor. In the present study, we focused on receptor phosphorylation, a key mechanism of receptor desensitization. Secretin receptor phosphorylation was demonstrated in intact transiently transfected COS cells and a stable receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary cell line in response to stimulation with native agonist. Secretin phosphoreceptor migrated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at M(r) 57,000-62,000 in its native state and at M(r) 42,000 after deglycosylation, similar to the receptor that had been affinity-labeled with 125I-[Tyr10,p-NO2-Phe22]-secretin-27. Phosphorylation occurred rapidly in a secretagogue concentration-dependent manner, with 0.1 microM secretin eliciting a 7.2-fold increase in phosphorylation after 2 min. One-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping after cyanogen bromide cleavage revealed a single band of M(r) 9400, corresponding in size to the carboxyl-terminal tail domain. This identification was confirmed with a truncation mutant in which potential sites of phosphorylation in the tail were eliminated and no agonist-stimulated phosphorylation was observed. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the secretin phosphoreceptor demonstrated predominance of phosphothreonine over phosphoserine (3.2:1), with no phosphotyrosine observed. Three distinct carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants were constructed to each eliminate a subset of potential phosphorylation sites, and differential levels of phosphorylation were observed. Appropriate biosynthetic processing, expression on the cell surface, and signaling for each of these constructs were ensured by demonstration of ligand binding and cAMP responsiveness. Thus, receptors in the recently described secretin receptor family are phosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation in a manner analogous to the beta-adrenergic receptor, likely representing an important molecular mechanism for receptor desensitization.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 89, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 260, "charStart": 91}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 441, "charStart": 262}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 548, "charStart": 443}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 753, "charStart": 550}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1016, "charStart": 755}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1186, "charStart": 1018}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1354, "charStart": 1188}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1541, "charStart": 1356}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1708, "charStart": 1543}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1898, "charStart": 1710}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 2083, "charStart": 1900}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 2342, "charStart": 2085}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Molecular Weight", "Phosphorylation", "Rats", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Receptors, Gastrointestinal Hormone", "Secretin"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

In vivo, phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region accounts for one-third of the insulin receptor phosphorylation and contains both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. Deletion of Tyr960 and 11 adjacent amino acids eliminated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region. Substitution of Tyr960 reduced this phosphorylation by more than 50%.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) affords a rapid and sensitive technique for determining peptides produced by the enzymatic digestion of phosphoroteins. When coupled with on-line immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), the combmation allows separation and mass spectrometric identification of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. In this study, the feasibility and general applicability of on-line IMAC/ESI/MS is investigated by using immobilized ferric ions for selective chelation of several phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine peptides. The sensitivity and practicality of the technique for phosphoproteins are demonstrated via the analysis of 30 pmol (\u223c0.7 \u03bcg) of bovine \u03b2-casein purified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and digested in situ with trypsin. It is observed that on-line IMAC/ESI/MS suffers less from sample losses than experiments performed off-line, suggesting that the limiting factors in sensitivity for this technique are the purification procedures and sample handling rather than the IMAC and mass spectrometry. Thus, the ability to inject the tryptic digest of an electroblotted protein directly onto the column without buffer exchange and to analyze the eluent directly via on-line coupling of the IMAC column to the mass spectrometer greatly reduces sample losses incurred through sample handling and provides a convenient method for analyzing phosphopeptides at low levels.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126}, "docId": "24227670", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 126, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 297, "charStart": 128}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 498, "charStart": 299}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 706, "charStart": 500}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 1013, "charStart": 708}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1289, "charStart": 1015}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1655, "charStart": 1291}]}

Phosphopeptide enrichment is essential for large-scale phosphoprotein profiling. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used in phosphopeptide enrichment, but it is limited in the isolation of multiphosphorylated peptides due to their strong binding. In this study, we found that citric acid greatly affects the binding of mono- and multiphosphopeptides with TiO2, which can be used for stepwise phosphopeptide separation coupled with mass spectrum (MS) identification. We first loaded approximately 1 mg of peptide mixture of HeLa cell digests onto TiO2 beads in highly concentrated citric acid (1 M).

However, low precursor charge states hinder the ability to obtain useful information through peptide sequencing by ETD, and the presence of acidic phosphate groups contributes to a low charge state of peptide ions. In the present report, we used a dinuclear zinc complex, (Zn2L)3+ (L = alkoxide form of 1,3-bis[bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino]propan-2-ol) for electrospray ionization (ESI), followed by ETD-MS2 analysis.

The past decade has been marked by the emergence of selective affinity media and sensitive mass spectrometry instrumentation that facilitated large-scale phosphoproteome analyses and expanded the repertoire of protein phosphorylation. Despite these remarkable advances, the precise location of the phosphorylation site still represents a sizable challenge in view of the labile nature of the phosphoester bond and the presence of neighboring phosphorylatable residues within the same peptide. This difficulty is exacerbated by the combinatorial distribution of phosphorylated residues giving rise to different phosphopeptide isomers. These peptides have similar physicochemical properties, and their separation by LC is often problematic. Few studies have described the frequency and distribution of phosphoisomers in large-scale phosphoproteomics experiments, and no convenient informatics tools currently exist to facilitate their detection. To address this analytical challenge, we developed two algorithms to detect separated and co-eluting phosphopeptide isomers and target their subsequent identification using an inclusion list in LC-MS/MS experiments. Using these algorithms, we determined that the proportion of isomers present in phosphoproteomics studies from mouse, rat, and fly cell extracts represents 3-6% of all identified phosphopeptides. While conventional analysis can identify chromatographically separated phosphopeptides, targeted LC-MS/MS analyses using inclusion lists provided complementary identification and expanded the number of phosphopeptide isomers by at least 52%.

We now have examined the phosphorylation and activation of Ca2+/CaM kinase II in synaptosomes, a Ca2+-dependent neurosecretory system consisting of isolated nerve terminals. Synaptosomes were prelabeled with 32Pi and the alpha subunit of Ca2+/CaM kinase II was immunoprecipitated. Under basal incubation conditions the alpha subunit was phosphorylated.

This was followed by a slower increase in the 32P content of the alpha subunit over the next 5 min of depolarization. The enhanced phosphorylation was characterized by an initial rise (2 s) and subsequent decrease (30 s) in the phosphothreonine content of the alpha subunit. In contrast, the phosphoserine content of the alpha subunit slowly increased during the course of depolarization. Thermolytic two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the alpha subunit demonstrated that depolarization stimulated the labeling of a phosphopeptide associated with autoactivation. In parallel experiments, unlabeled synaptosomes were depolarized, and lysates of these synaptosomes were assayed for Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. Depolarization produced a rapid (less than or equal to 2 s) increase in Ca2+-independent Ca2+/CaM kinase II activity. This activity returned to basal levels by 60 s.

At the other two binding sites in the ASU, it appears that spatial proximity of neighboring SH2 domains in the crystal induces alternative modes of binding of this phosphopeptide.", "type": ["Journal Article"], "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 195}, "docId": "31441171", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 195, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 502, "charStart": 197}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 603, "charStart": 504}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 741, "charStart": 605}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 892, "charStart": 743}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 1045, "charStart": 894}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1237, "charStart": 1047}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1417, "charStart": 1239}]}

Recent studies have shown that the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, associates with the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 as it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during platelet aggregation: a process that can be mimicked in part by small synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of PECAM-1 encompassing tyrosine residues Tyr-663 or Tyr-686. To further examine the molecular requirements for PECAM-1/SHP-2 interactions, we generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell lines that stably expressed mutant forms of PECAM-1 harboring tyrosine to phenylalanine (Tyr --> Phe) mutations in the cytoplasmic domain. Y663F and Y686F forms of PECAM-1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated to a somewhat lesser extent than wild-type PECAM-1, and a doubly substituted Y663,686F form of PECAM-1 failed to become tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues 596, 636 and 701 do not serve as substrates for cellular kinases. Interestingly, SHP-2 binding was lost when either Tyr-663 or Tyr-686 were changed to phenylalanine, indicating that both residues are required for SHP-2/PECAM-1 association. Although PECAM-1 phosphopeptides NSDVQpY663TEVQV and DTETVpY686SEVRK stimulated the catalytic activity of the phosphatase to a similar extent, surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that the Tyr-663-containing peptide had approximately 10-fold higher affinity for SHP-2 than did the Tyr-686 peptide. Finally, peptido-precipitation analysis showed that the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 reacted preferentially with the Tyr-663 PECAM-1 phosphopeptide, while the Tyr-686 phosphopeptide associated only with the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of the phosphatase.

The wild-type virus and deletion mutants (dl1263, dl1265, dl2194, and dl2198) were used for infection. On the basis of our results and published data (M. Schwyzer, R. Weil, and H. Zuber, J. Biol.

The amino-terminal part of the molecule contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. One phosphothreonine residue was located in the prolinerich C-terminal end of the molecule at position 701 or 708. On the basis of the concensus as to the amino acid sequence surrounding the recognition sites for protein kinases, it was possible to more precisely locate this phosphothreonine at residue 701. Moreover, the C-terminal part of the molecule contained phosphoserine at a more internal position. In addition, this study firmly established the presence of a phosphothreonine in the N-terminal part of large T antigen.

Our previous studies on the p85/p110alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase showed that the p85 regulatory subunit inhibits the p110alpha catalytic subunit, and that phosphopeptide activation of p85/p110alpha dimers reflects a disinhibition of p110alpha (Yu, J., Zhang, Y., McIlroy, J., Rordorf-Nikolic, T., Orr, G. A., and Backer, J. M. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 1379-1387). We now define the domains of p85 required for inhibition of p110alpha. The iSH2 domain of p85 is sufficient to bind p110alpha but does not inhibit it. Inhibition of p110alpha requires the presence of the nSH2 domain linked to the iSH2 domain. Phosphopeptides increase the activity of nSH2/iSH2-p110alpha dimers, demonstrating that the nSH2 domain mediates both inhibition of p110alpha and disinhibition by phosphopeptides. In contrast, phosphopeptides did not increase the activity of iSH2/cSH2-p110alpha dimers, or dimers composed of p110alpha and an nSH2/iSH2/cSH2 construct containing a mutant nSH2 domain. Phosphopeptide binding to the cSH2 domain increased p110alpha activity only in the context of an intact p85 containing both the nSH2 domain and residues 1-322 (the SH3, proline-rich and breakpoint cluster region-homolgy domains). These data suggest that the nSH2 domain of p85 is a direct regulator of p110alpha activity.

Application of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) to analysis and characterization of phosphopeptides in peptide mixtures may have a limitation, because of the lower ionizing efficiency of phosphopeptides than nonphosphorylated peptides in MALDI MS. In this work, a binary matrix that consists of two conventional matrices of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (3-HPA) and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) was tested for phosphopeptide analysis. 3-HPA and CCA were found to be hot matrices, and 3-HPA not as good as CCA and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) for peptide analysis. However, the presence of 3-HPA in the CCA solution with a volume ratio of 1:1 could significantly enhance ion signals for phosphopeptides in both positive-ion and negative-ion detection modes compared with the use of pure CCA or DHB, the most common phosphopeptide matrices. Higher signal intensities of phosphopeptides could be obtained with lower laser power using the binary matrix. Neutral loss of the phosphate group (-80 Da) and phosphoric acid (-98 Da) from the phosphorylated-residue-containing peptide ions with the binary matrix was decreased compared with CCA alone. In addition, since the crystal shape prepared with the binary matrix was more homogeneous than that prepared with DHB, searching for 'sweet' spots can be avoided. The sensitivity to detect singly or doubly phosphorylated peptides in peptide mixtures was higher than that obtained with pure CCA and as good as that obtained using DHB.

We describe a new procedure that enables selective detection and sequencing of Ser-, Thr-, and Tyr-phosphopeptides at the low femtomole level in protein digests. Radiolabeling with 32P is not required, nor is prior chromatographic separation of the peptide mixture. One to two microliters of the unfractionated protein digest is infused at basic pH into an electrospray mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 20-40 nl/min using an ultra-low flow sprayer. A precursor-ion scan of m/z 79 (PO-3) produces a mass spectrum containing only the molecular ions of the phosphopeptides that are present in the sample. In cases where the protein sequence is known, the peptide molecular weights obtained are often sufficient to identify the specific sequences that are phosphorylated. If the protein sequence is not known, tandem MS with collision-induced dissociation of phosphopeptide precursor-ions may be used to obtain the amino acid sequences including the site(s) of phosphorylation. We demonstrate that phosphopeptides may be selectively detected using as little as 3 fmol of a 10 fmol/microl solution and that sequence information for a phosphopeptide in the mixture may be obtained using as little as 3 femtomole of the same solution.

Consequently, PTPases and DSPases have a central role controlling signal transduction and cell cycle progression. Currently, there are few readily available potent inhibitors of PTPases or DSPases other than vanadate.

Distinct effects of the neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and the mitogenic factor, epidermal growth factor. We recently characterized the association of the 44-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase, also known as extracellular-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), with the 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp90rsk), one of its putative substrates in intact PC12 cells. Using antibodies to ERK1 that precipitate a functional ERK1.pp90rsk phosphoprotein complex, we demonstrate here the regulation of both kinases by various stimuli. In mouse fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors, insulin and vanadate swiftly stimulated ERK1 activity within 5 min. While the hormonal effect was short-lived, vanadate led to a first peak followed by a progressively increasing second phase. In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor, which is a growth promoting factor, provokes a rapid but evanescent activation of ERK1. In contrast, nerve growth factor (NGF), which acts as a neuronal differentiation factor for PC12 cells, induced a swift monophasic response followed by a sustained second phase. This strikingly different pattern of ERK1 stimulation by NGF and epidermal growth factor was associated to a contrasting effect on ERK1 cellular translocation. Thus, NGF induced a nuclear translocation of ERK1, while epidermal growth factor was without noticeable effect on ERK1 localization. In both cell systems all effectors tested stimulated ERK1 phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in an 1:1 ratio. During ERK1 inactivation, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were dephosphorylated in a similar fashion. Concurrent with ERK1 activation was the de novo appearance of phosphothreonine and an increase in phosphoserine on pp90rsk. The pp90rsk phosphothreonine content paralleled the ERK1 activity more closely than the phosphoserine level. These results provide compelling evidence that in fibroblasts and PC12 cells ERK1 plays a direct role in the phosphorylation of pp90rsk and that pp90rsk represents a physiologically relevant substrate of extracellular-regulated kinases. Finally, we would like to suggest that the differentiating action of NGF in PC12 cells might be due, at least in part, to the conjunction of its sustained and robust stimulation of ERK1 and pp90rsk, and of its induction of ERK1 nuclear translocation.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 144, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 261, "charStart": 146}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 506, "charStart": 263}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 669, "charStart": 508}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 794, "charStart": 671}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 919, "charStart": 796}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 1047, "charStart": 921}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1225, "charStart": 1049}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1385, "charStart": 1227}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1518, "charStart": 1387}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1649, "charStart": 1520}, {"index": 11, "charEnd": 1756, "charStart": 1651}, {"index": 12, "charEnd": 1880, "charStart": 1758}, {"index": 13, "charEnd": 1989, "charStart": 1882}, {"index": 14, "charEnd": 2226, "charStart": 1991}, {"index": 15, "charEnd": 2477, "charStart": 2228}], "mesh": ["Amino Acids", "Animals", "Antibodies", "Autoradiography", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases", "Epidermal Growth Factor", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Homeostasis", "Insulin", "Kinetics", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Molecular Weight", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "PC12 Cells", "Phosphates", "Phosphorus Radioisotopes", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinases", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases", "Vanadates"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

The high specificity of this approach was demonstrated by the isolation of phosphopeptides from the digests of model phosphoproteins. The strong affinity of ZrO2 nanoparticles to phosphopeptides enables the specific enrichment of phosphopeptides from a complex peptide mixture in which the abundance of phosphopeptides is two orders of magnitude lower than that of nonphosphopeptides.

The pathogenesis of enamel caries involves a succession of demineralization and remineralization activities. The net effect can result in lesion consolidation when the redeposited minerals improve the resistance of the surface to the extent that the usual level of cariogenic activity cannot cause mineral dissolution. Since it has been established that the caries process is a continuum, albeit one that is interrupted numerous times daily, it is therefore possible to intervene at any stage with a therapeutic product or an intervention methodology. Incorporation of remineralizing treatments into routine dental care programmes will have a strong impact on the public health aspects of caries control. A recent advancement in the phenomenon of remineralization is the casein phosphopeptides. These casein phosphopeptides localize the amorphous calcium phosphate and are proved to be anticariogenic.

D., and Cohn, Z. A. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 164, 165-179). Concomitantly, LPS promotes the myristoylation of a 68K PKC substrate, shown to be equivalent to the 80/87K PKC substrate found in brain and fibroblasts (Aderem, A. A., Albert, K. A., Keum, M. M., Wang, J. K., Greengard, P., and Cohn, Z. A. (1988) Nature 332, 362-364). We have now examined the effect of LPS on the phosphorylation of this 68K PKC substrate. We report here that LPS modifies the kinetics and extent of phosphorylation of the 68K protein. While treatment with LPS alone induces low level phosphorylation of the 68K protein, it markedly increases the rate of subsequent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-dependent phosphorylation of this protein. Phosphorylation in LPS-treated macrophages was maximal 1-2 min after administration of PMA, while maximal phosphorylation in macrophages not exposed to LPS was only achieved 6 min after addition of PMA. In addition to increasing the rate of PMA-dependent phosphorylation of the 68K protein in macrophages, LPS also promoted the phosphorylation of a novel peptide on the 68K protein. Thus while PMA stimulated the phosphorylation of two thermolytic phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 1 and 2), the low level of phosphorylation observed with LPS alone was found to occur on phosphopeptides 1 and 2 as well as on a novel phosphopeptide (phosphopeptide 3). Furthermore, LPS treatment of macrophages potentiated phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides when the cells were subsequently stimulated with PMA. While phosphorylation stimulated by LPS and PMA was slightly more than additive for phosphopeptides 1 and 2, it was markedly synergistic (increased 14.5-fold) for phosphopeptide 3. Phosphorylation of all three phosphopeptides occurred exclusively on serine.

Plentiful studies have established a close association between aberrant phosphorylation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we applied a quantitative phosphoproteomics platform combining dimethylation labeling and online 3D strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX)-titanium oxide (TiO2)/RP-LTQ-Orbitrap to compare phosphoproteomes between three pairs of HCC tissues and non-tumor counterparts. This analysis yielded 7868 quantifiable phosphopeptides and numerous up- or down-regulated candidates. Increased phosphorylation of LMNA and NIPA was confirmed using specific antibodies. To expand our verification capability, we evaluated the use of LTQ-Orbitrap run in SIM/Accurate inclusion mass screening (AIMS) mode with a super-SILAC mixture as an internal standard to quantify a subset of phosphopeptide candidates in HCC tissue samples. In sample I used for discovery experiment, we successfully quantified 32 (in SIM mode) and 30 (in AIMS mode) phosphopeptides with median coefficients of variation (CVs) of 7.5% and 8.3%, respectively. When the assay was applied to other three pairs of HCC specimens for verification experiment, 40 target phosphopeptides were quantified reliably (~7.5% CV), and more than half of them were differentially expressed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Collectively, these results indicate the feasibility of using super-SILAC mix-SIM/AIMS assays for targeted verification of phosphopeptides discovered by large-scale phosphoproteome analyses of HCC specimens. In this study, we developed a strategy for conducting both discovery and targeted verification of deregulated phosphoproteins in HCC tissue specimens on LTQ-Orbitrap.

An initial ion/ion reaction that employed multiply protonated amino-terminated dendrimers converted phosphopeptide anions to the doubly protonated species.

Here, we studied the mechanism of this interaction in detail. Phosphopeptides representing the SHP-1 candidate binding sites in the Ros cytoplasmic domain, pY2267 and pY2327, display high affinity binding to the SHP-1 N-terminal SH2 domain (Kd=217 nM and 171 nM, respectively).

Complexes of both molecules could be detected by F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in intact HEK293 and COS7 cells.

These kinases associate with the antigen receptor complex, and the activities of Blk, Fyn(T), and Lyn increase upon receptor engagement. Differences in the amino acid sequences and patterns of expression of these kinases suggest that they serve distinct functions. In this communication it is shown that the SH2 domains from Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T) preferentially bind distinct sets of phosphoproteins from the mature B cell line A20. These interactions were found to depend on recognition of phosphotyrosine. The Blk SH2 domain bound more than 10 distinct phosphoprotein species, most of which reacted with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody; the phosphotyrosine content of these proteins was increased if surface immunoglobulin was cross-linked before extracts were made. Phosphoproteins of 72, 76, 115, and 130 kDa bound to the SH2 domains of Blk, Lyn, and Fyn(T). Phosphoamino acid analysis of these four proteins revealed that each contained phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine.

Phosphorylation of the large and small isoforms of myelin-associated glycoprotein (L- and S-MAG) was investigated in primary oligodendrocyte cultures and in immortalized Schwann cells by incubating the cells with inorganic [32P]phosphate and immunoprecipitating MAG. In oligodendrocytes, both L- and S-MAG were phosphorylated, but L-MAG was much more heavily labeled. In Schwann cells, most of the phosphorylation was in S-MAG, which is the predominant isoform expressed by these cells. In both types of cells, the principal phosphorylated amino acid in MAG was serine. Radioactive phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine were also detected in the MAG from oligodendrocytes. In Schwann cells, there was less phosphorylation of threonine and labeled phosphotyrosine was not detected. In both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, the phosphorylation of MAG was stimulated by phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore, but not by forskolin. The results indicate that the phosphorylation of MAG is catalyzed by protein kinase C and possibly other calcium-activated kinases in both types of myelinating cells, but not by cAMP-activated kinase. An inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase, ammonium vanadate, increased the amount of radioactive phosphate in MAG several fold in both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. However, even in the presence of vanadate, the great majority of radioactivity in MAG was in phosphoserine and only a small amount was in phosphotyrosine, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins may indirectly increase the phosphorylation of MAG.

Erbium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation from boiling phosphoric acid and incubated overnight in erbium chloride solutions. The resulting powder was embedded in a monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) polymer. The monolith was synthesized in a spin column by radical polymerization. Erbium phosphate demonstrated a high affinity and selectivity for phosphopeptides due to the strong interaction of trivalent erbium ions with the phosphate groups of phosphopeptides. The high selectivity and performance of the designed spin columns were demonstrated by successfully enriching phosphopeptides from tryptically digested protein mixtures containing the model phosphoproteins \u03b1- and \u03b2-casein, bovine milk, and human saliva. By the implementation of several washing steps, unspecific components were removed and the enriched phosphopeptides were effectively eluted from the spin columns under alkaline conditions.

The sequence of this protein kinase would predict that it is a protein serine/threonine kinase, which at first seemed incongruent with the cloning method. However, recent reports indicate that some protein kinases can phosphorylate both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. To determine whether this protein kinase, which we call PYT (for phosphotyrosine picked threonine kinase), was a dual-specificity protein kinase we investigated its substrate specificity when expressed in bacteria. The catalytic domain was active as a protein kinase when expressed from any of several promoters and when expressed as a TrpE fusion protein. All experiments that resulted in an active protein kinase, as judged by incorporation of 32P by metabolic labeling, also resulted in the generation of proteins that were recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the metabolically labeled proteins that were recognized by the antibodies consistently yielded large amounts of phosphothreonine and only trace amounts of phosphotyrosine. We mapped the phosphorylation sites in the phosphorylated PYT protein and found only phosphothreonine; 90% of the radioactivity mapped to a threonine in the region autophosphorylated by many protein kinases.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an anti-cancer target due to its critical role in mitotic progression. A growing body of evidence has documented that Peptide-Plk1 inhibitors showed high Plk1 binding affinity. However, phosphopeptides-Plk1 inhibitors showed poor cell membranes permeability, which limits their clinical applications. In current study, nine candidate phosphopeptides consisting of non-natural amino acids were rationally designed and then successfully synthesized using an Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) strategy. Moreover, the binding affinities and selectivity were evaluated via fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The results confirmed that the most promising phosphopeptide 6 bound to Plk1 PBD with the IC50 of 38.99\u202fnM, which was approximately 600-fold selectivity over Plk3 PBD (IC50\u202f=\u202f25.44\u202f\u03bcM) and nearly no binding to Plk2 PBD. Furthermore the intracellular activities and the cell membrane permeability of phosphopeptide 6 were evalutated. Phosphopeptide 6 demonstrated appropriate cell membrane permeability and arrested HeLa cells cycle in G2/M phase by regulating CyclinB1-CDK1. Further, phosphopeptide 6 showed typical apoptotic morphology and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. In conclusion, we expect our discovery can provide new insights into the further optimization of Plk1 PBD inhibitors.", "sentence": [{"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 111, "index": 0}, {"index": 1, "charEnd": 211, "charStart": 113}, {"index": 2, "charEnd": 317, "charStart": 213}, {"index": 3, "charEnd": 441, "charStart": 319}, {"index": 4, "charEnd": 648, "charStart": 443}, {"index": 5, "charEnd": 754, "charStart": 650}, {"index": 6, "charEnd": 974, "charStart": 756}, {"index": 7, "charEnd": 1087, "charStart": 976}, {"index": 8, "charEnd": 1229, "charStart": 1089}, {"index": 9, "charEnd": 1332, "charStart": 1231}, {"index": 10, "charEnd": 1450, "charStart": 1334}], "mesh": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Apoptosis", "Caspase 3", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Drug Design", "G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Phosphopeptides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins"], "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}

Kinetic correlation to autophosphorylation of specific sites in the beta subunit. The kinetics of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the beta subunit of the mouse insulin receptor and activation of receptor kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a model substrate were compared. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse proreceptor was determined to locate tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides. Receptor was first incubated with unlabeled ATP to occupy nonrelevant autophosphorylation sites, after which [32P]autophosphorylation at relevant sites and attendant activation of substrate phosphorylation were initiated with [gamma-32P]ATP and insulin. Activation of substrate phosphorylation underwent an initial lag of 10-20 s during which there was substantial 32P-autophosphorylation of tryptic phosphopeptides p2 and p3, but not p1. Following the lag, incorporation of 32P into p1 and the activation of substrate phosphorylation increased abruptly and exhibited identical kinetics. The addition of substrate to the receptor prior to ATP inhibits insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, and consequently substrate phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the receptor in the presence of substrate inhibited primarily the incorporation of 32P into p1 and drastically inhibited substrate phosphorylation. From Edman radiosequencing of 32P-labeled p1, p2, and p3 and the amino acid sequence of the mouse receptor, the location of each phosphopeptide within the beta subunit was determined. Further characterization of these phosphopeptides revealed that p1 and p2 represent the triply and doubly phosphorylated forms, respectively, of the region within the tyrosine kinase domain containing tyrosines 1148, 1152, and 1153. The doubly phosphorylated forms contain phosphotyrosines either at positions 1148 and 1152/1153 or positions 1152 and 1153.

The use of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification enables a high-throughput quantification of peptides via reporter ion signals in the low m/z range of tandem mass spectra. PQD, a form of ion trap collision activated dissociation, allows for detection of low mass-to-charge fragment ions, and electron transfer dissociation is especially useful for sequencing peptides that contain post-translational modifications.
