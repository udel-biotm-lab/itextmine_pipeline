We used a proteomic approach to identify phosphopeptide-binding modules mediating signal transduction events in the DNA damage response pathway. Using a library of partially degenerate phosphopeptides, we identified tandem BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domains in PTIP (Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein) and in BRCA1 as phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-specific binding modules that recognize substrates phosphorylated by the kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related) in response to gamma-irradiation. PTIP tandem BRCT domains are responsible for phosphorylation-dependent protein localization into 53BP1- and phospho-H2AX (gamma-H2AX)-containing nuclear foci, a marker of DNA damage. These findings provide a molecular basis for BRCT domain function in the DNA damage response and may help to explain why the BRCA1 BRCT domain mutation Met1775 --> Arg, which fails to bind phosphopeptides, predisposes women to breast and ovarian cancer.", "title": {"charStart": 0, "charEnd": 76}, "entity": {"EF:MGFw": {"duid": "EF:MGFw", "entityType": "Trigger", "charEnd": 1035, "source": "eFIP", "charStart": 1021, "sentenceIndex": 4, "entityText": "phosphopeptides"}, "EF:eo2U": {"duid": "EF:eo2U", "entityType": "Protein", "charEnd": 1035, "source": "eFIP", "charStart": 1021, "sentenceIndex": 4, "entityText": "phosphopeptides"}, "EF:9Vxa": {"duid": "EF:9Vxa", "entityType": "Trigger", "charEnd": 1019, "source": "eFIP", "charStart": 1016, "sentenceIndex": 4, "entityText": "bind"}, "EF:2w3u": {"duid": "EF:2w3u", "attribute": [], "entityType": "Site", "charEnd": 1035, "source": "eFIP", "charStart": 1021, "sentenceIndex": 4, "entityText": "phosphopeptides"}}, "mesh": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins", "BRCA1 Protein", "Caffeine", "Calorimetry", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Nucleus", "Cytosol", "DNA Damage", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Gamma Rays", "Humans", "Nuclear Proteins", "Peptide Library", "Phosphopeptides", "Phosphorylation", "Phosphoserine", "Phosphothreonine", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proteomics", "Signal Transduction", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "relation": {"EF:RyQQ": {"relationType": "NON_IMPACT", "source": "eFIP", "argument": [{"role": "INTERACTANT", "entity_duid": "EF:eo2U"}, {"role": "PPITRIGGER", "entity_duid": "EF:9Vxa"}, {"role": "PTMTRIGGER", "entity_duid": "EF:MGFw"}, {"role": "SITE_OTHER", "entity_duid": "EF:2w3u"}], "duid": "EF:RyQQ", "attribute": [{"key": "direction", "value": "none"}, {"key": "impact_score", "value": 1}, {"key": "impact_type", "value": ""}, {"key": "ppi_type", "value": "binding"}]}}, "type": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is regulated by EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation and by phorbol ester-stimulated, protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) mediated phosphorylation at identified sites. The EGF receptor contains additional phosphorylation sites including a prominent phosphothreonine and several phosphoserines which account for the majority of phosphate covalently bound to the receptor in vivo. We have identified three of these sites in EGF receptor purified from 32P-labeled A431 cells. The major phosphothreonine was identified as threonine 669 in the EGF receptor sequence. Phosphoserine residues were identified as serines 671 and 1046/1047 of the EGF receptor. Two other phosphoserine residues were localized to tryptic peptides containing multiple serine residues located carboxyl-terminal to the conserved protein kinase domain. The amino acid sequences surrounding the three identified phosphorylation sites are highly conserved in the EGF receptor and the protein products of the v-erb B and neu oncogenes. Analysis of predicted secondary structure of the EGF receptor reveals that all of the phosphorylation sites are located near beta turns. In A431 cells phosphorylation of the serine residues was dependent upon serum. In mouse B82 L cells transfected with a wild type human EGF receptor. EGF increased the 32P content in all tryptic phosphopeptides. A mutant EGF receptor lacking protein tyrosine kinase activity was phosphorylated only at threonine 669.
